  *Differentiation Strategy (Tiered Task):*
  - *Standard Track (B1)*: "Stories" article (~100 words). Focus on narrative and personal opinion.
  - *Advanced Track (B2 First for Schools)*: "Stories" article (140-190 words). Requires more complex character analysis, plot evaluation, and sophisticated descriptive language.

  *Theoretical Justification:*
  This approach aligns with *Tomlinson’s (2001) Differentiation by Product*, allowing learners to engage with the same theme ('Stories') while producing outputs that match their proficiency. By offering a 'Tiered Task', we ensure all learners work within their *Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978)*, preventing boredom for advanced learners and anxiety for the standard group.
