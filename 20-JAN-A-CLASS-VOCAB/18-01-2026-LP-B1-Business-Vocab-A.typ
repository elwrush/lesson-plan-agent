#differentiation_box[
  This lesson utilizes a "Creative Editorial" layout that provides high information density. Fast finishers are challenged with Task 4's high-level sentence transformations, while scaffolding is provided via the integrated "Language Help" boxes for weaker students. This approach provides i+1 input (Krashen, 1982).
