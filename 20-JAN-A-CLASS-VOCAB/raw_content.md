# Denham Farm Bakery Text
DENHAM FARM BAKERY is a family business, with three different generations (father, son and granddaughter) of the family currently working with a team of 90 employees. The company was set up in 1991 with the aim of producing a variety of bread of the highest quality. The Denham family saw there was a growing demand for organic products in the 1990s, and they soon became experts in the field of organic bread-making.

The company is run from a factory in Ilminster, where the bread is baked daily and then delivered to shops across the south-west of England. The firm has expanded a great deal in the last 20 years, but it still remains a family business.
