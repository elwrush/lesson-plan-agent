## A2 Text: "The History of the London Police"

### Rhetorical Features
- **Purpose**: Informative historical narrative
- **Tone**: Neutral, factual, textbook-like
- **Strategy**: Strict chronological progression with explicit time markers
- **Voice**: Third person, impersonal

### Coherence & Cohesion
- **Paragraph structure**: Single block (no visual breaks)
- **Primary cohesive device**: Time adverbials ("In 1750", "Fifty years later", "Until 1920")
- **Connectors used**: and, but, so, because (core A2 set only)
- **Reference**: Lexical repetition dominant ("policemen" ×4, "London" ×4)
- **Pronoun chains**: Minimal; "they" for single group reference

### Lexis
- **Vocabulary band**: High-frequency concrete nouns (city, streets, money, people)
- **Topic vocabulary**: thieves, stole, police, officers, horses
- **Collocations**: Transparent/literal ("protect the city streets", "rode horses")
- **Abstract nouns**: None
- **Idioms**: None

### Grammar Structures Present
- Past Simple (dominant): "started", "worked", "stole"
- Used to + infinitive: "used to protect"
- There + be: "there were so many thieves"
- Simple passive: "they were not paid", "was started"
- Basic relative clause: "thieves who stole money"
- Comparatives: "more policemen", "even better"

### Key A2 Markers
1. Time-sequenced narrative structure
2. Lexical repetition over pronoun reference
3. Simple connectors only (no "however" or "although")
4. Concrete, visualizable vocabulary
5. Past Simple as dominant tense

## B1 Text: "The Body Shop" (Anita Roddick)

### Rhetorical Features
- **Purpose**: Personal reflection with persuasive undertone
- **Tone**: Personal, conversational, inspirational
- **Strategy**: Personal narrative → thesis → call to engagement
- **Voice**: First person ("I", "we") — increasing scope through text

### Coherence & Cohesion
- **Paragraph structure**: Three distinct paragraphs with clear functions
  1. Background/history
  2. Thesis/philosophy
  3. Future orientation
- **Connectors used**: and, but, for, nor, as, "In business, as in life"
- **Discourse markers**: "Now", "I'd like to think"
- **Reference**: Pronoun chains ("I" → "we" → "the people who work for")
- **Lexical chains**: business → company → work → run → succeed

### Lexis
- **Vocabulary band**: Mix of concrete and abstract
- **Abstract nouns**: object, message, success, feeling, love, limits, ideas
- **Opinion language**: "I believe", "I have always wanted", "I find that exciting"
- **Collocations**: "run a successful business", "have a feeling of family"
- **Semi-idiomatic**: "giving up what we really believe in"

### Grammar Structures Present
- Present Perfect Simple: "I have learned", "has been"
- Gerunds as complements: "giving up what we believe"
- Infinitive of purpose: "to succeed", "to feed my children"
- Defining relative clauses: "what I have learned", "the people who work"
- Modal verbs (ability/possibility): "can be run", "can do good"
- That-clause complement: "The message is that..."

### Key B1 Markers
1. Abstract vocabulary present but supported by context
2. Paragraph structure with clear topic shifts
3. Present Perfect for life experience
4. Personal opinion markers ("I believe", "I find")
5. Expanded connector range (for, nor, as)
6. First-person voice with shifting scope

## B2 Text: "An Eye for Detail" (Susan Shepherd)

### Rhetorical Features
- **Purpose**: Magazine profile/feature article
- **Tone**: Appreciative, descriptive, literary
- **Strategy**: Scene-setting → process → history → present situation
- **Voice**: Third person with extensive direct quotation
- **Figurative language**: Simile ("like an affectionate aunt"), metaphor ("get your hands dirty")

### Coherence & Cohesion
- **Paragraph structure**: Five paragraphs with sophisticated topic progression
  1. Garden as source material
  2. Studio working method
  3. Seasonal rhythm and decay fascination
  4. Personal history and philosophy
  5. Current situation and artist's connection
- **Advanced cohesive devices**:
  - Substitution: "the only real ones were wild" (flowers omitted)
  - Demonstrative reference: "Much of this is due to"
  - Synonymy chains: garden/plants/flowers/subjects/material
- **Discourse markers**: "In fact", "More usually", "But", "Nowadays", "Despite"
- **Quotation integration**: Seamless embedding of direct speech

### Lexis

- **Figurative expressions**: "come-what-may attitude", "far-off lands"
- **Collocations**: "seed themselves", "appealed to", "build up the painting"
- **Register**: Semi-formal magazine prose with conversational quotations

### Grammar Structures Present
- Passive (full range): "is best known for", "was really his garden", "were sold"
- Non-defining relative clauses: Parenthetical information within sentences
- Reduced relative clauses: "plants that originated", "exhibitions to prepare for"
- Participle clauses: "finding time to work in the garden has been difficult"
- Complex embedding: "the large garden that surrounds her house is the source"
- Fronted adverbials: "With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for..."
- Implied conditionals: "when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised"

### Key B2 Markers
1. Long, complex sentences with multiple embeddings (25-35 words)
2. Sophisticated paragraph-level cohesion (substitution, ellipsis)
3. Low-frequency vocabulary requiring inference
4. Figurative language and literary tone
5. Full passive range including continuous contexts
6. Direct quotation integrated grammatically
7. Participle clauses for sentence variety

## C1 Text: "The Day I Gave Up Smoking"

### Rhetorical Features
- **Purpose**: Personal essay with ironic self-examination
- **Tone**: Self-deprecating, witty, intellectually honest
- **Strategy**: Paradox structure (didn't want to stop → stopped easily)
- **Voice**: First person intimate; draws reader into internal contradictions
- **Rhetorical devices**:
  - Irony: "I positively enjoyed smoking"
  - Rhetorical question: "Could I also conquer the world?"
  - Reported speech for humour: "'I shan't be trying to stop myself'"
  - Parenthetical asides: "— and I still do"

### Coherence & Cohesion
- **Paragraph structure**: 15 short paragraphs (essay/journalistic pacing)
- **Cohesion through implicit logic**: Logical relationships inferred, not stated
- **Advanced cohesive devices**:
  - Contrastive pairs: "For one thing... For another"
  - Stance markers: "I suppose", "After all", "Surprisingly"
  - Time deixis: "exactly two months and three weeks ago"
- **Connectors used**: and, but, so, after all, for one thing, for another
- **Discourse markers**: "I find it curious myself", "I suppose", "Surprisingly"

### Lexis
- **Vocabulary band**: Low-frequency + sophisticated abstractions
- **Sophisticated vocabulary**: remorseless, unexceptional, pottering, displacing, consciously

- **Collocations**: "threw off colds", "pangs of desire", "work to deadlines"
- **Register mixing**: Formal ("wholly resented") + colloquial ("the anti-smoking mob")
- **Nominalization**: "my inability to explain", "the possibility of not being a smoker"

### Grammar Structures Present
- Past Perfect: "I had not intended", "had simply gone along"
- Cleft sentences: "what happened was that..."
- Inversion (correlative): "so the notion of stopping began to feel attractive"
- Nominalization: "my inability to explain", "the possibility of not being"
- Fronted adverbials: "In many senses", "Surprisingly"
- Passive + infinitive: "to be addressed"
- Participle clauses: "having a cigarette was an activity in itself"
- Mixed conditionals (implied): "it would not be right to expect"

### Key C1 Markers
1. Ironic/self-aware voice with deliberate contradictions
2. Cleft sentences for emphasis ("what happened was that...")
3. Nominalization transforming verbs/adjectives into abstract nouns
4. Implicit cohesion — logical relationships inferred, not stated
5. Register mixing — formal and colloquial within same text
6. Stance-marking throughout: "I suppose", "I find it curious", "Surprisingly"
7. Rhetorical questions embedded naturally
8. Short paragraphs for essay rhythm (journalistic pacing)

## Implications for Text Generation

### When Writing A2 Texts:
- Use strict chronological structure with explicit time markers
- Repeat key nouns rather than using complex pronoun chains
- Limit connectors to: and, but, so, because, when, before, after
- Keep vocabulary concrete and visualizable
- Avoid abstract nouns and figurative language
- Use Past Simple as default narrative tense

### When Writing B1 Texts:
- Structure clearly with 2-3 paragraphs serving distinct functions
- Introduce abstract vocabulary but support with concrete examples
- Use first person voice with opinion markers
- Employ Present Perfect for experience/relevance
- Expand connectors but avoid formal markers (no "Nevertheless")

### When Writing B2 Texts:
- Use sophisticated paragraph progression with implicit links
- Employ figurative language and literary register
- Integrate quotation and multiple perspectives
- Use full passive range and participle clauses
- Include low-frequency vocabulary requiring contextual inference
- Vary sentence structure significantly (simple to complex)

### When Writing C1 Texts:
- Use implicit logical cohesion — relationships inferred not stated
- Employ cleft sentences for emphasis ("What happened was...")
- Include nominalization ("my inability", "the possibility of")
- Mix registers deliberately (formal + colloquial)
- Use stance markers throughout ("I suppose", "Surprisingly")
- Create ironic or self-aware voice with deliberate contradictions
- Vary paragraph length dramatically (short punchy + longer reflective)
- Embed rhetorical questions naturally
