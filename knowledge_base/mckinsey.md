# McKinsey Storytelling Framework (SCR)

## Core Objective

The goal of a presentation is not to store data, but to influence stakeholders to implement recommendations.

**Data alone does not persuade; storylines persuade.**

## 1. The SCR (SCQA) Framework

A universal storytelling structure used by top consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) to organize complex information into a persuasive narrative.

### S - Situation (The Context)

- Establishes prior knowledge and context.
- Introduces the status quo or topic.
- Explains why the topic is important/relevant right now.

### C - Complication (The Conflict)

- Introduces the problem or disruption that has arisen.
- Explains why the current situation is no longer sustainable or why the problem is critical.
- Implied Q (Question): "What should we do about this?" (Usually unspoken).

### R - Resolution (The Answer)

- Provides specific solutions or recommendations.
- Acts as the blueprint for fixing the problem defined in the Complication.

## 2. The Workflow: Word vs. PowerPoint

The most common mistake is opening PowerPoint immediately after analysis.

### Step 1: Analysis & Synthesis

Complete all data analysis and form conclusions before storylining.

### Step 2: Storylining in Word

Draft the narrative in a text document (Microsoft Word).

**Why Word?**
- Easier to see the entire flow on one page.
- Facilitates faster iteration and feedback cycles.
- Makes it easier to spot logical gaps or contradictions compared to flipping through slides.

### Step 3: Slide Building

Only open PowerPoint once the text storyline is finalized and approved.

## 3. The Dot-Dash Structure

A hierarchical method for organizing arguments within the text document.

### The Dot (•)

- **Definition:** The key statement or assertion.
- **In PowerPoint:** This becomes the Action Title (Headline) of the slide.

### The Dash (–)

- **Definition:** The supporting data, evidence, or synthesis that justifies the Dot.
- **In PowerPoint:** This becomes the Slide Body (Charts, graphs, bullet points).

## 4. Verification: Logic Flows

To ensure the presentation is bulletproof, check two specific logic flows:

### Horizontal Flow (The Story)

**Test:** Can you understand the entire argument by reading only the Action Titles (Dots) of every slide in sequence?

The titles alone should tell a cohesive story without needing the data.

### Vertical Flow (The Proof)

**Test:** Does the Slide Body (Dash) completely prove or support the Action Title (Dot)?

There should be no claim in the title that is not backed by data on the slide.
