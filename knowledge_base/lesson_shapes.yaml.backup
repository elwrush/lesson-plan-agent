- Shape A: Text-based presentation of language:
    Pedagogical justification: Here the idea is that language is contextualized and introduced
      using a reading or listening text briefly first (but this is not the main aim)
      and then language from the text is highlighted and clarified (checking meaning,
      form and pronunciation) before doing further practice. The overall main lesson
      aim might be: By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to use the
      affirmative and negative forms of the past simple in the context of verbally
      describing their childhood memories.
    Example lesson plan:
      Header: <b>Objective:</b><br>By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to use the affirmative, negative, interrogative and short answer forms of the present perfect and the past simple in the context of their life experiences.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>[Teacher Name]<br><b>Date:</b><br>[DD-MM-YY]<br><b>Duration:</b><br>[X] minutes<br><b>CEFR Level:</b><br>A2/B1<br><b>Lesson Shape:</b><br>A (Text-based presentation of language)<br><b>Materials:</b><br>Life Elementary Unit 10B materials<br><b>Assessment:</b><br>n/a<br><b>Systems:</b><br>Grammar

- Shape B: Language Practice:
    Pedagogical justification: This is connected to/follows on from lesson shape A
      or C. This lesson may follow a previous one where the teacher would have clarified
      the target language but decided that the students need more practice. It will
      involve different practice stages, e.g. controlled written practice, controlled
      oral practice, less controlled written/speaking practice and freer written/oral
      practice. The overall lesson aim might be: By the end of the lesson, learners
      will have had an opportunity to practice using going to and will be better able
      to talk about their plans for the weekend. Remember to try to have a variety
      of task types and focuses, moving from more controlled to freer. Remember that
      this lesson is the second part of the previous lesson, so if you use a lead-in,
      keep the same context, if possible. This type of lesson may need some student
      preparation, e.g. pre-teaching vocab, group discussion, role preparation. Feedback
      stages are also important.

- Shape C: Test-Teach-Test Presentation of Language:
    Pedagogical justification: Here the idea is that learners are tested on their
      knowledge of the language before moving on to clarification. The teach monitors
      the task carefully to see what problems the students have and then clarifies
      (checking meaning, form and pronunciation) as necessary – i.e. any new language
      or items the students had problems with. In other words, if there are 15 pieces
      of vocabulary in the test, the teacher would most likely not clarify every item
      – only problematic ones. This is followed by further practice. The main aim
      here will usually reflect the clarification and practice aims reflected in the
      previous two lesson types.
    Example lesson plan:

- Shape D: Situational Presentation (PPP):
    Pedagogical justification: Here the idea is that the teacher introduces a context
      in which new language is to be taught. Having done this, the teacher then presents
      the target language (checking meaning, form and pronunciation) before providing
      controlled practice. When presenting pronunciation, specific features of the
      form should be modeled, and phonemic script should be included to highlight
      difficulties, especially for students from specific linguistic backgrounds (e.g.,
      Thai students). In this stage, the teacher monitors the task very carefully
      to see what problems the students are having, correct errors and ensure correct
      use of the TL. Finally, there is a freer practice (production) in which the learners
      use the TL productively and with a communicative end, with more fluent use of
      the TL encouraged.

      task, not worrying about using pre-selected language or grammatical accuracy.
      They then report how this was accomplished to the class, before going on to
      analyze relevant language or features of a text. Finally, they practice this
new language through some controlled practice activities or, ideally, repeating a
      similar task and incorporating that language into it. The overall main lesson
      aim might be: By the end of the lesson, the learners will have completed a speaking/writing
      task about and be better able to talk/write about films they’ve seen recently.
      They will also be better able to use functional language used for recommending.

- Shape H: SCR Receptive Skills (Storytelling Framework) – listening or reading:
    Pedagogical justification: This shape applies the McKinsey SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution)
      storytelling framework to receptive skills lessons. The lesson is structured as
      a narrative journey where students discover a problem through the text and arrive
      at an insight. Each stage advances the story rather than just practicing skills.
      The slideshow provides Action Titles (claims) and the worksheet provides evidence.
      Main aim format: By the end of the lesson, learners will have discovered [insight]
      through practicing [skill] in the context of [topic].
    Example lesson plan:
      Header: <b>Objective:</b><br>By the end of the lesson, learners will have discovered
        that politeness is cultural rather than universal through practicing reading
        for gist and detail in the context of an article about cross-cultural manners.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>Ed
