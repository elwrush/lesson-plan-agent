The search results provided do not contain the detailed specifications you're looking for. While they confirm that **English Profile provides language-specific guidance for each CEFR level**, including information about vocabulary and grammar suitable for teaching at each level[6], the actual criterial features—such as specific grammar structures, vocabulary lists, discourse markers, sentence length, word count, and cohesion devices—are not included in these search results.

The search results indicate that:

- English Profile offers **online tools** including the English Vocabulary Profile Online and English Grammar Profile Online, which are searchable databases containing research findings on what English vocabulary and grammar is suitable for each CEFR level[6].
- At the A1 level, learners are expected to have basic understanding of English grammar and simple sentence structures, while C2 learners are expected to use complex sentence structures accurately[5].
- The CEFR describes what learners can do in reading, writing, listening, and speaking at each level[2][4], but the search results only provide general capability descriptions rather than specific linguistic features.

To access the detailed criterial features you're seeking, you would need to consult the **English Profile website directly**, particularly the English Grammar Profile Online and English Vocabulary Profile Online tools[6], which contain the specific breakdowns of grammar structures, vocabulary, and discourse features for each CEFR level.
