- Shape G: Task-Based Learning/Teaching (TBL/TBT):
    Pedagogical justification: In TBL, the idea is that the learners first carry out
      a task in pairs or small groups, focusing on communication and completing the
      task, not worrying about using pre-selected language or grammatical accuracy.
      They then report how this was accomplished to the class, before going on to
      analyze relevant language or features of a text. Finally, they practice this
new language through some controlled practice activities or, ideally, repeating a
      similar task and incorporating that language into it. The overall main lesson
      aim might be: By the end of the lesson, the learners will have completed a speaking/writing
      task about and be better able to talk/write about films they've seen recently.
      They will also be better able to use functional language used for recommending.
    Example lesson plan:
      Header: <b>Objective:</b><br>Main aim: By the end of the lesson, learners will have completed a task about and will be better able to talk about things they'd hate to be without. Subsidiary aim: Learners will also have practiced and developed the sub-skills of listening for specific information and detail in the context of a recording about things people would hate to be without.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>[Teacher Name]<br><b>Date:</b><br>[DD-MM-YY]<br><b>Duration:</b><br>36 minutes<br><b>CEFR Level:</b><br>B1<br><b>Lesson Shape:</b><br>G (Task-Based Learning)<br><b>Materials:</b><br>Audio recording of 5 people talking about things they'd hate to be without, worksheet for listening task<br><b>Assessment:</b><br>n/a<br><b>Skills:</b><br>Speaking and Listening
