name: Shape I - SCR Systems (Grammar/Vocabulary)
description: Grammar or vocabulary lesson where students encounter a communication breakdown that their current language cannot solve, then learn the "Hero Tool" (new grammar/vocab) that fixes it.

# Core Principle
The Complication is a FUNCTIONAL FAILURE: "Your current grammar/vocabulary makes you sound [ROBOT/BORING/RUDE]. You LOSE something (respect, opportunity, connection)."

pedagogical_justification: |
  This shape applies the McKinsey SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution) storytelling framework to systems (grammar/vocabulary) lessons at any CEFR level FOR THAI MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. Students begin with an initial approach, encounter a communication breakdown that makes them sound ineffective, and learn the grammatical/ lexical "Hero Tool" that solves the problem.
  
  CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS from PPP/traditional productive lessons:
  1. Students TRY to communicate BEFORE learning the target language
  2. The Complication shows them WHY their current approach fails (functional breakdown)
  3. The target language is introduced as the SOLUTION, not the starting point
  4. Thai L1 interference is explicitly addressed with เคย/แล้ว scaffolds
  
  The framework remains constant but complexity scales with level:
  - A1: "I like X but Y" (simple contrast)
  - B1: "Although X, Y. However, Z." (counterarguments)
  - C1: Nuanced essays with multiple perspectives

main_aim_format: |
  By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to use [target language] to [functional goal] in the context of [topic].

# Thai L1 Scaffolds (MANDATORY for Thai Middle Schoolers)

thai_l1_scaffolds:
  present_perfect_kei:
    thai_concept: "เคย (kei) = ever/used to"
    english_equivalent: "Have you ever...? / I have been to..."
    problem: "Students say 'You ever go Japan?' or use Past Simple with dates"
    scr_complication: "Somchai says 'I went to Japan in 2019' in job interview → sounds like ancient history, not current profile"
    scr_resolution: "Present Perfect = Experience Filter (เคย). Deletes the calendar, highlights WHO YOU ARE NOW."
    mapping_rule: "If you can put เคย in the Thai sentence, use Present Perfect in English"
    example:
      thai: "Khun kei pai Yee-poon mai? (คุณเคยไปญี่ปุ่นไหม?)"
      english_correct: "Have you been to Japan?"
      english_wrong: "You went to Japan? / You ever go Japan?"
      
  present_perfect_leaw:
    thai_concept: "แล้ว (leaw) = already/finished"
    english_equivalent: "I have eaten / I have finished"
    problem: "Students say 'I eat already' or translate แล้ว literally"
    scr_complication: "Student says 'I eat rice already' → sounds childish, broken"
    scr_resolution: "Have + V3 captures the feeling of แล้ว (action complete, focus on NOW state)"
    example:
      thai: "Gin khao leaw (กินข้าวแล้ว)"
      english_correct: "I have eaten (so I'm full now)"
      english_wrong: "I eat already / I ate rice already"
      
  verb_conjugation_trap:
    thai_reality: "Thai verbs NEVER change (Pai = go/went/gone)"
    english_reality: "English verbs change (go → went → gone)"
    problem: "Students forget V3 forms → 'I have go' / 'I have saw'"
    scr_resolution: "Gamify the V3 hunt - make it a race/competition"
    critical_distinction:
      gone_vs_been: 
        error: "I have gone to Japan"
        meaning: "You are STILL in Japan (not here!)"
        correct: "I have been to Japan"
        meaning: "You went and CAME BACK (experience complete)"
        
  past_simple_dates_trap:
    problem: "Students focus on WHEN (calendar) instead of WHO (profile)"
    bad_example: "I went to Chiang Mai in 2010. I went to Phuket in 2012. I visited Japan in 2015."
    what_it_sounds_like: "History book / Robot / Boring list"
    fix: "Use Present Perfect to build your PROFILE, not your CALENDAR"
    good_example: "I have been to Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Japan."
    what_it_sounds_like: "Experienced person / Cultural knowledge / Worldly"

# Middle-School-Appropriate SCR Scenarios

      Guild Leader: "OK... but can you do it NOW?"
    what_you_sound_like: "Living in the past / Not confident"
    hero_tool: "Present Perfect (Experience Filter)"

    what_you_sound_like: "Current gamer / Interesting profile"
    
  instagram_bio:
    situation: "Writing your English IG bio to look cool"
    current_language: "Simple present only"

    hero_tool: "Present Perfect for achievements"
    resolution_example: |
      "I've visited 12 provinces. I've learned 3 instruments. I've watched over 50 anime series."
    what_it_sounds_like: "Accomplished / Experienced / Interesting"

    current_language: "Past Simple"
    complication_example: |
      "I tried this. It didn't work."

    hero_tool: "Present Perfect to show persistence"  
    resolution_example: |
      "I've tried this 3 times. It hasn't worked yet, but I'll keep trying!"
    what_it_sounds_like: "Persistent / Serious / Not a quitter"

# SCR Stage Structure for Grammar (Present Perfect Example)

stage_structure:
  situation:
    purpose: "Establish the context where they NEED to communicate"
    teacher_mindset: "You CAN communicate... but there's a better way"
    stages:
      - "1. Set the scenario (gaming guild / new friend / social media bio)"
      - "2. Elicit what they would say NOW (use Past Simple / simple present)"
      - "3. Record their attempts (write on board - we'll revisit)"
    
  complication:
    purpose: "Show the FUNCTIONAL FAILURE of their current approach"
    teacher_mindset: "Your grammar makes you sound [BAD THING]. You LOSE something."
    stages:
      - "4. The Breakdown - Show the 'bad version' dialogue (like Somchai's job interview)"
      - "5. Analyze the failure: How does it sound? (Robot / Boring / Weak)"
      - "6. Reveal the cost: What do you lose? (Respect / Opportunity / Connection)"
    key_questions:
      - "How does [character] sound?"
      - "Would YOU hire them / friend them / follow them?"
      - "What's the problem with focusing on WHEN instead of WHO?"
      
  resolution:
    purpose: "Introduce the target language as the HERO TOOL"
    teacher_mindset: "This grammar is your superpower. It fixes EVERYTHING."
    stages:
      - "7. Introduce the Hero: [Target Language] is the [Metaphor]"
      - "8. Teach the form (Make it a game - V3 race for Present Perfect)"
      - "9. Show the 'good version' dialogue (same scenario, better outcome)"
      - "10. Practice + Produce (redo the original scenario WITH the Hero Tool)"
    key_frames:
      present_perfect: "Present Perfect is your EXPERIENCE FILTER. It deletes the calendar (2019, Monday) and shows WHO YOU ARE NOW."
      comparatives: "Comparatives are your UPGRADE BUTTON. They show progress and improvement."
      modals: "Modals are your POLITENESS SHIELD. They protect you from sounding rude."

        - "In Thai, you might say 'Phom pai End' and context shows you mean 'I've been there.' But in English, 'I went' sounds like it's FINISHED and you can't do it anymore."

          • Thai: "Khun kei pai End mai?" (คุณเคยไปเอนด์ไหม?)
          • English: "Have you been to the End?"
          • RULE: If you can put เคย, use Present Perfect.

      time: 5
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Resolution - Learn the form (V3 race game)

          • Teams race to shout the V3: gone, seen, played, built, beaten, won, made, fought, explored
          • Award points for correct answers.
        - Drill the critical pair:
          • GONE (still there) vs BEEN (went and came back)
          • "I have GONE to the End" = You're still there!

          Guild Leader: "Awesome! You're in. Welcome to the guild!"
        - Ask: "How does the applicant sound NOW?"
        - Ss suggest: Experienced / Professional / Confident / Like a PRO
        - "See the difference? Same achievements. But NOW it's your PROFILE, not your PAST."
      time: 5
