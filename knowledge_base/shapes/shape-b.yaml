name: Shape B - Language Practice
description: Follow-on practice lesson from Shape A or C, with varied practice stages moving from controlled to freer.

pedagogical_justification: |
  This is connected to/follows on from lesson shape A or C. This lesson may follow a previous one where the teacher would have clarified the target language but decided that the students need more practice. It will involve different practice stages, e.g. controlled written practice, controlled oral practice, less controlled written/speaking practice and freer written/oral practice. The overall lesson aim might be: By the end of the lesson, learners will have had an opportunity to practice using going to and will be better able to talk about their plans for the weekend. Remember to try to have a variety of task types and focuses, moving from more controlled to freer. Remember that this lesson is the second part of the previous lesson, so if you use a lead-in, keep the same context, if possible. This type of lesson may need some student preparation, e.g. pre-teaching vocab, group discussion, role preparation. Feedback stages are also important.
