name: Shape J - SCR Productive Skills (Message Structure)
description: Speaking or writing lesson where students use SCR to structure their MESSAGE and Dot-Dash to plan content before producing.

# Core Principle
SCR structures the MESSAGE ITSELF (Situation paragraph → Complication paragraph → Resolution paragraph). Dot-Dash separates main points (Dots) from supporting details (Dashes).

pedagogical_justification: |
  This shape applies the McKinsey SCR framework to PRODUCTIVE output (writing/speaking) FOR THAI MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. Unlike Shape I (which uses SCR to TEACH new grammar), Shape J uses SCR as the STRUCTURE OF THE OUTPUT ITSELF.
  
  CRITICAL DISTINCTION from Shape I (Systems):
  - Shape I: SCR shows WHY you need new grammar (Complication = your current grammar fails)
  - Shape J: SCR IS THE STRUCTURE of what you write/say (Situation paragraph, Complication paragraph, Resolution paragraph)
  
  CRITICAL DISTINCTION from traditional productive lessons (Shape F):
  - Shape F: Open-ended "write about X" or "talk about Y"
  - Shape J: Explicit SCR framework + Dot-Dash planning prevents rambling
  
  Thai L1 Challenge: Kreng Jai (เกรงใจ) culture makes Thai students apologize/waffle before stating problems. SCR forces directness: "Here's the situation. Here's the problem. Here's what I want."

main_aim_format: |
  By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to [write/speak] [output type] using the SCR structure in the context of [topic].

# Thai L1 Challenge: Kreng Jai (เกรงใจ)

thai_kreng_jai_problem:
  definition: "เกรงใจ = Fear of causing trouble/being a burden. Politeness culture."
  manifestation_in_english:
    writing: "I am so sorry to bother you, I know you are busy, but maybe the mouse is not good..."
    speaking: "Um... I don't know if this is a good idea, but... um... maybe... if you want... you could go to..."
  result: "Long, wandering messages that bury the point. Western readers/listeners lose patience."
  scr_fix: "SCR forces students to STATE the problem directly in Paragraph 2 (Complication)."

# Dot-Dash Framework (McKinsey)

dot_dash_principle:
  dots: "Main points / Headlines / Claims (What you're saying)"
  dashes: "Supporting details / Evidence / Examples (Why it's true)"
  
  function_by_skill:
    writing: |
      Dots = Topic sentences (one per paragraph)
      Dashes = Supporting sentences (2-3 per paragraph)
    speaking: |
      Dots = Cue card headlines (what you'll say)
      Dashes = Mental details (how you'll explain it)
  
  vertical_check: "Does the Dash PROVE the Dot? If not, delete it."

# SCR Structure for Productive Skills

scr_for_writing:
  paragraph_1_situation: "State what happened normally. No emotion yet."
  paragraph_2_complication: "The 'But.' What went wrong?"
  paragraph_3_resolution: "What do you want them to do? Be specific."
  
scr_for_speaking:
  beginning_situation: "Acknowledge the listener's goal/desire."
  middle_complication: "Show why the obvious choice won't work."
  end_resolution: "Offer your solution."

# Example Lesson 1: Writing - "The Complaint Email"

example_writing_lesson:
  context: "Thai learners write long apology emails before stating complaints due to Kreng Jai"
  scenario: "You ordered a Logitech mouse from Lazada. It arrived broken and wrong color."

    <b>Objective:</b><br>By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to write clear complaint emails using the SCR structure in the context of online shopping issues.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>[Teacher Name]<br><b>Date:</b><br>[DD-MM-YY]<br><b>Duration:</b><br>46 minutes<br><b>CEFR Level:</b><br>B1<br><b>Lesson Shape:</b><br>J (SCR Productive Skills - Writing)<br><b>Materials:</b><br>Email template, Dot-Dash planning worksheet, sample complaint scenarios<br><b>Assessment:</b><br>Complaint email CA<br><b>Skills:</b><br>Writing
  
  stages:
    - stage_name: The Thai Problem (Kreng Jai)
      stage_number: 1
      aim: To show the cultural communication breakdown
      procedure: |
        - Show a "Bad Email" on slide:
          "Dear Sir/Madam, I am so sorry to bother you. I know you are very busy and I don't want to cause any trouble. I ordered a mouse but maybe it's not so good. I'm sorry if I made a mistake. Could you please help me if it's not too much trouble? Thank you so much. Sorry again."
        - Ask: "What's the problem?"
        - Ss identify: Too many apologies, no clear problem statement, unclear request
        - Explain: "In Thai culture, เกรงใจ (Kreng Jai) is polite. But in English business writing, it wastes the reader's time. They want: What happened? What's wrong? What do you want?"
      time: 5
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Teach the SCR Structure
      stage_number: 2
      aim: To introduce the 3-paragraph framework
      procedure: |
        - Write on board:
          Paragraph 1: SITUATION (What happened normally)
          Paragraph 2: COMPLICATION (What went wrong - the 'But')
          Paragraph 3: RESOLUTION (What you want them to do)
        - Show model:
          P1: "I ordered a Logitech Mouse on December 25th. Order #12345."
          P2: "However, when I opened the box, the mouse was broken. Also, the color was pink, not black."
          P3: "Please send a replacement black mouse by Tuesday, or issue a full refund."
        - Ask: "Which paragraph says sorry?" (None!)
        - "In Western business culture, stating facts clearly IS polite."
      time: 6
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Dot-Dash Planning (Prevent Rambling)
      stage_number: 3
      aim: To teach content planning before writing
      procedure: |
        - "Before you write sentences, plan your DOTS (main points) and DASHES (evidence)."
        - Example for Paragraph 2 (Complication):
          DOT: The mouse is broken.
            DASH: The scroll wheel is stuck.
            DASH: There is a crack on the side.
        - Vertical Check: "Does 'crack on the side' PROVE 'mouse is broken'? Yes. Keep it."
        - Counter-example:
          DOT: The mouse is broken.
            DASH: The box was wet. ❌
        - "Does 'box was wet' prove 'mouse is broken'? No. It's a different problem. Delete."
        - Hand out Dot-Dash worksheet. Ss plan Paragraph 2 for their scenario. 3 min.
        - Teacher checks: Are the Dashes proving the Dot?
      time: 10
      interaction: T-Ss → S
    
    - stage_name: Write Paragraph 2 Only (Controlled)
      stage_number: 4
      aim: To practice just the Complication paragraph
      procedure: |
        - "Now turn your Dot-Dash plan into SENTENCES."
        - Model transformation:
          DOT: The mouse is broken.
            DASH: Scroll wheel stuck.
          BECOMES: "When I opened the box, the mouse was broken. The scroll wheel is stuck and doesn't move."
        - Ss write Paragraph 2 only. 5 min.
        - Pair check: Does it have (1) a clear problem statement, (2) 2 pieces of evidence?
      time: 8
      interaction: S → Ss-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Complete Email (Freer Practice)
      stage_number: 5
      aim: To produce full 3-paragraph email
      procedure: |
        - Ss write Paragraphs 1 and 3 to complete the email. 10 min.
        - Reminder: 
          P1 = Just the facts (order number, date, product)
          P3 = Specific request (replacement by [date] OR refund)
        - Peer editing checklist:
          ☐ Does P1 state the situation clearly?
          ☐ Does P2 have a DOT (problem) + 2 DASHES (evidence)?
          ☐ Does P3 ask for something specific?
          ☐ Are there zero apologies?
      time: 12
      interaction: S → Ss-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Reflection (Cultural Shift)
      stage_number: 6
      aim: To solidify the mindset change
      procedure: |
        - "In Thai, we say 'ขอโทษ' (sorry) a lot. Why?"
        - Ss discuss: Politeness, don't want to offend.
        - "In English business, what's polite?"
        - Key insight: "Being CLEAR is polite. Wasting their time with apologies is RUDE."
        - Exit ticket: "SCR helps me write emails that are ________________."
          (Expected: direct, clear, professional)
      time: 5
      interaction: T-Ss

# Example Lesson 2: Speaking - "The Tourist Recommendation"

example_speaking_lesson:
  context: "Students give list-based recommendations without persuasive logic"
  scenario: "A tourist asks 'Where should I visit in Bangkok?'"
  
  header: |
    <b>Objective:</b><br>By the end of the lesson, learners will be better able to give persuasive tourist recommendations using the SCR structure in the context of Bangkok attractions.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>[Teacher Name]<br><b>Date:</b><br>[DD-MM-YY]<br><b>Duration:</b><br>46 minutes<br><b>CEFR Level:</b><br>B1<br><b>Lesson Shape:</b><br>J (SCR Productive Skills - Speaking)<br><b>Materials:</b><br>Cue cards, Bangkok attraction photos, Dot-Dash worksheet<br><b>Assessment:</b><br>n/a<br><b>Skills:</b><br>Speaking
  
  stages:
    - stage_name: The Problem (List Without Logic)
      stage_number: 1
      aim: To show ineffective recommendation structure
      procedure: |
        - Teacher models "Bad Recommendation":
          "You should go to Grand Palace... and Wat Arun... and Chatuchak Market... um... they're all good."
        - Ask: "Why is this weak?"
        - Ss identify: No reasons, just a list, no connection to tourist's needs
        - "This is like a menu. You're listing options. But a GOOD recommendation SOLVES A PROBLEM."
      time: 4
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Teach SCR for Recommendations
      stage_number: 2
      aim: To introduce the persuasive structure
      procedure: |
        - SCR Framework for recommendations:
          SITUATION: Acknowledge what the tourist wants.
          COMPLICATION: Show why the obvious choice won't work.
          RESOLUTION: Offer your alternative solution.
        - Model:
          S: "You want to see beautiful temples."
          C: "But Grand Palace is very hot (35°C), expensive (500 THB), and too crowded right now."
          R: "You should go to Wat Arun at sunset instead. It's by the river, so it's breezy. Only 100 THB. Great photos and not crowded."
        - Ask: "Did I solve the tourist's problem?" (Yes - they get temples WITHOUT the heat/crowds/cost)
      time: 6
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Dot-Dash Cue Cards
      stage_number: 3
      aim: To plan speaking content
      procedure: |
        - "You can't memorize a script. But you CAN remember 3 DOTS (headlines)."
        - Show cue card structure (write on 3 index cards):
          Card 1: "Bangkok is HOT." (Dot)
            Mental Dashes: 35 degrees, sweaty, traffic
          Card 2: "Grand Palace is a TRAP." (Dot)
            Mental Dashes: Tour buses, 500 THB, crowded
          Card 3: "Wat Arun is BREEZY." (Dot)
            Mental Dashes: By river, 100 THB, nice photos
        - Vertical Check: "Does 'breezy' solve 'hot'? Yes."
        - Ss create 3-card plan for their own scenario (Chatuchak vs. Siam Paragon, Street food vs. mall food, etc.). 5 min.
      time: 8
      interaction: T-Ss → S
    
    - stage_name: Practice with Cue Cards Only
      stage_number: 4
      aim: To speak from headlines, not scripts
      procedure: |
        - Pair up. A = tourist, B = local guide.
        - B speaks using ONLY the 3 cue cards (can't read a script).
        - A asks follow-up: "Why is it breezy?" → Forces B to use the Mental Dashes.
        - Switch roles. 6 min total (3 min each).
        - Teacher monitors: Are they using S-C-R order? Are they connecting logically?
      time: 8
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Perform Without Cards (Fluency Challenge)
      stage_number: 5
      aim: To internalize the structure
      procedure: |
        - New pairs. Same scenario. But NOW: No cue cards.
        - Ss must remember the 3 DOTs only.
        - If they forget a word (e.g., "crowded"), the SCR structure reminds them what IDEA comes next (the Complication), so they can say "too many people" instead.
        - Perform 2x each. 10 min.
        - Whole class: Best recommendation wins (teacher judges on logic, not accent).
      time: 15
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage_name: Reflection
      stage_number: 6
      aim: To solidify the framework
      procedure: |
        - "Before today, how did you recommend things?"
        - Ss: "Just list places."
        - "Now?"
        - Ss: "Show the problem first, THEN give the solution."
        - "What if you forget your English words?"
        - Key insight: "The SCR structure reminds me what IDEA to say next, so I can find different words."
      time: 5
      interaction: T-Ss

# Comparison: Shape J vs Shape F (Traditional Productive)

shape_j_vs_shape_f:
  traditional_shape_f_approach:
    instruction: "Write an email complaining about a product."
    result: "Students write whatever structure feels natural (often rambling, apologetic)"
    problem: "No framework prevents Kreng Jai waffle"
    
  scr_shape_j_approach:
    instruction: "Write a 3-paragraph email: P1 = Situation, P2 = Complication + 2 pieces of evidence, P3 = Resolution (specific request)."
    result: "Students follow clear structure, preventing cultural rambling"
    benefit: "Dot-Dash prevents including irrelevant details"

# Quick Reference: When to Use Shape J

use_shape_j_when:
  - "Students need to write/speak with CLEAR STRUCTURE (intro-body-conclusion)"
  - "Thai cultural habits (Kreng Jai, indirect communication) sabotage clarity"
  - "Output requires PERSUASION or PROBLEM-SOLVING logic"
  
examples:
  - "Complaint emails (online shopping, hotel issues)"
  - "Recommendations (tourist advice, product reviews)"
  - "Opinion essays (agree/disagree with reasons)"
  - "Presentations (pitch, proposal)"
  
do_not_use_for:
  - "Creative writing (stories, poems) — no need for rigid structure"
  - "Casual conversation — too formal"
