- Shape D: Situational Presentation (PPP):
    Pedagogical justification: Here the idea is that the teacher introduces a context
      in which new language is to be taught. Having done this, the teacher then presents
      the target language (checking meaning, form and pronunciation) before providing
      controlled practice. When presenting pronunciation, specific features of the
      form should be modeled, and phonemic script should be included to highlight
      difficulties, especially for students from specific linguistic backgrounds (e.g.,
      Thai students). In this stage, the teacher monitors the task very carefully
      to see what problems the students are having, correct errors and ensure correct
      use of the TL. Finally, there is a freer practice (production) in which the learners
      use the TL productively and with a communicative end, with more fluent use of
      the TL encouraged.
