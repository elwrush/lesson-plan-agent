name: Shape D - Situational Presentation (PPP)
description: Present-Practice-Produce format with contextual introduction, explicit teaching of meaning/form/pronunciation, controlled practice, then freer production.

pedagogical_justification: |
  Here the idea is that the teacher introduces a context in which new language is to be taught. Having done this, the teacher then presents the target language (checking meaning, form and pronunciation) before providing controlled practice. When presenting pronunciation, specific features of the form should be modeled, and phonemic script should be included to highlight difficulties, especially for students from specific linguistic backgrounds (e.g., Thai students). In this stage, the teacher monitors the task very carefully to see what problems the students are having, correct errors and ensure correct use of the TL. Finally, there is a freer practice (production) in which the learners use the TL productively and with a communicative end, with more fluent use of the TL encouraged.
