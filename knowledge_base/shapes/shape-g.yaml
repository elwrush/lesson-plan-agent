name: Shape G - Task-Based Learning/Teaching (TBL/TBT)
description: Task-first methodology where learners complete a communicative task, report on it, analyze language, then practice/repeat with new language.

pedagogical_justification: |
  In TBL, the idea is that the learners first carry out a task in pairs or small groups, focusing on communication and completing the task, not worrying about using pre-selected language or grammatical accuracy. They then report how this was accomplished to the class, before going on to analyze relevant language or features of a text. Finally, they practice this new language through some controlled practice activities or, ideally, repeating a similar task and incorporating that language into it. The overall main lesson aim might be: By the end of the lesson, the learners will have completed a speaking/writing task about and be better able to talk/write about films they've seen recently. They will also be better able to use functional language used for recommending.

  Main aim: By the end of the lesson, learners will have completed a task about and will be better able to [function] in the context of [topic]. 
  Subsidiary aim: Learners will also have practiced [sub-skill/language].

    <b>Objective:</b><br>Main aim: By the end of the lesson, learners will have completed a task about and will be better able to talk about things they'd hate to be without. Subsidiary aim: Learners will also have practiced and developed the sub-skills of listening for specific information and detail in the context of a recording about things people would hate to be without.<br><b>Teacher:</b><br>[Teacher Name]<br><b>Date:</b><br>[DD-MM-YY]<br><b>Duration:</b><br>36 minutes<br><b>CEFR Level:</b><br>B1<br><b>Lesson Shape:</b><br>G (Task-Based Learning)<br><b>Materials:</b><br>Audio recording of 5 people talking about things they'd hate to be without, worksheet for listening task<br><b>Assessment:</b><br>n/a<br><b>Skills:</b><br>Speaking and Listening
  
  stages:
    - stage: Pre-task (lead-in)
      stage_number: 1
      stage_aim: To pre-task (lead-in)
      procedure: |
        - Tell Ss that today we'll talk about things we can't live without.
        - Display pictures of things and objects on PP. In pairs, Ss tell each other how important are those things in their life. 3 min.
        - Feedback.
      time: 4
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage: Pre-task (listening for specific information and detail)
      stage_number: 2
      stage_aim: To pre-task (listening for specific information and detail)
      procedure: |
        - Teacher tells ss that they will listen to 5 people talking about things they would hate to be without and that they have to complete their worksheet with the following information: the object and how the person describes it.
        - Hand out the worksheet.
        - Play the recording pausing so that Ss can write their answers. 3:40 seconds.
        - Pair check. Play it again if necessary. Whole-class feedback on PP.
      time: 8
      interaction: T-Ss
    
    - stage: Task Cycle
      stage_number: 3
      stage_aim: To task cycle
      procedure: |
        - Making the list: teacher tells students that now they are going to make their own list of 5 things they'd hate to be without. Display some suggestions on PP. 3 min.
        - Preparing arguments: Teacher tells students to think about and make notes on how they can describe all things on their lists and why they are important to them. Display prompts on PP. 5 min.
        - Reporting: In pairs, Ss tell each other what their objects are and why they are important to them. 5 min.
      time: 13
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage: Planning
      stage_number: 4
      stage_aim: To planning
      procedure: |
        - Now, Ss work in teams to find out the most common object chosen and decide which was the most unusual object and why. 3 min.
      time: 3
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage: Report
      stage_number: 5
      stage_aim: To report
      procedure: |
        - Rearrange the teams so that there is a student from each team sitting together (assign numbers).
        - In the new teams, Ss tell each other what their team decided (most common and most unusual object) 4 min.
      time: 4
      interaction: Ss-Ss
    
    - stage: Analysis
      stage_number: 6
      stage_aim: To analysis
      procedure: |
        - T praises good language use and then highlights mistakes and emphasizes the language that students could have used in the task, especially language used to: introduce objects, describe objects and say why it's important.
      time: 4
      interaction: T-Ss
