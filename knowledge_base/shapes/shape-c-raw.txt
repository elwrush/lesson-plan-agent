- Shape C: Test-Teach-Test Presentation of Language:
    Pedagogical justification: Here the idea is that learners are tested on their
      knowledge of the language before moving on to clarification. The teach monitors
      the task carefully to see what problems the students have and then clarifies
      (checking meaning, form and pronunciation) as necessary – i.e. any new language
      or items the students had problems with. In other words, if there are 15 pieces
      of vocabulary in the test, the teacher would most likely not clarify every item
      – only problematic ones. This is followed by further practice. The main aim
      here will usually reflect the clarification and practice aims reflected in the
      previous two lesson types.
