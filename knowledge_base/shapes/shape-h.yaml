name: Shape H - SCR Receptive Skills (Storytelling Framework)
description: Receptive skills lesson structured as a narrative journey where students discover a problem through the text and arrive at an insight using the McKinsey SCR framework.

# Core Principle
The Complication is NOT just "challenge" — it's a COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN or functional failure that their current skills cannot solve.

pedagogical_justification: |
  This shape applies the McKinsey SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution) storytelling framework to receptive skills lessons FOR THAI MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. The lesson is structured as a narrative journey where students discover a functional problem (a communication breakdown) through the text and arrive at a skill/strategy that solves it.
  
  CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS from traditional reading/listening lessons:
  2. The Resolution provides a "Solution Strategy" (skill/tool) that solves the problem. A unifying METAPHOR must be selected (e.g., 'Hero Tool', 'Reverse Engineering', 'Cheat Code').
  4. For listening: Teach selective attention and prediction
  
  Each stage advances the story rather than just practicing skills. The slideshow provides Action Titles (claims) and the worksheet provides evidence.

main_aim_format: |
  By the end of the lesson, learners will have discovered [insight/skill] through practicing [specific sub-skill] in the context of [topic].

# Metaphor Selection Protocol (CRITICAL)

metaphor_selection:
  rule: "Do NOT default to 'Hero Tool'. Engage the user to select the best unifying concept."
  procedure:
    1. "Analyze the context (e.g., Gaming, Business, Travel)."
    2. "Propose 2-3 relevant metaphors."
    3. "Example: For a business lesson, 'Efficiency Upgrade' is better than 'Hero Tool'."
    4. "Ask the user to confirm or suggest their own."

# Thai L1 Scaffolds (MANDATORY for Thai Middle Schoolers)

thai_l1_scaffolds:
  ambiguity_tolerance:
    thai_habit: "Dictionary Addiction - stopping at every unknown word to translate"
    problem: "Students read word-for-word, lose flow, miss the main point"
    scr_fix: "Complication forces them to decide WITHOUT knowing every word"
    example: "BTS breakdown announcement - you have 30 seconds to decide: wait or take taxi? You don't have time to translate 'intermittent disruptions' - just find '45 minutes'"
    
  context_vs_calendar:
    thai_habit: "Thai has no tense marking - context determines time"
    problem: "Students don't realize English REQUIRES time markers with Past Simple"
    scr_fix: "Show how missing markers creates confusion in English"
    
# Middle-School-Appropriate SCR Scenarios

age_appropriate_scenarios:
  transport:
    situation: "BTS/MRT to tutoring or mall"
    complic ation: "Train breakdown announcement (formal English, long)"
    resolution: "Scan for time only → message parent"
    skill_taught: "Scanning for specific information + Ambiguity Tolerance"
    
  school:
    situation: "Teacher posts long homework instructions in LINE group"
    complication: "Too much text, need to know deadline fast"
    resolution: "Scan for date/time words only"
    skill_taught: "Scanning + ignoring描述 context"
    
  food:
    situation: "Ordering for friend with shrimp allergy at school canteen"
    complication: "Menu description is deliciously descriptive but unclear"
    resolution: "Scan ingredients list for กุ้ง/shrimp paste keywords"
    skill_taught: "Scanning for allergens + keyword hunting"
    
  digital:
    situation: "Watching English YouTube tutorial for Minecraft/ROV"
    complication: "Accent is unfamiliar, speaks fast"
    resolution: "Watch for visual cues + key action words (click, drag, place)"
    skill_taught: "Listening for gist + visual context"
    
  social_media:
    situation: "Reading English comment thread on TikTok/IG"
    complication: "Slang, abbreviations, no proper grammar"
    resolution: "Identify sentiment (😊/😠) + main opinion, ignore grammar"
    skill_taught: "Reading for tone + pragmatic meaning"

# SCR Stage Structure (Fixed Pattern)

stage_structure:
  situation:
    purpose: "Establish familiar context + create cognitive tension"
    teacher_mindset: "You already think you understand, but..."
    stages:
      - "1. Establish common ground (What do you already know?)"
      - "2. Pre-teach ONLY blocking vocabulary (3-4 words max with Thai /phonemic/: translation + context)"
      - "3. Create tension (Prediction task or incomplete information)"
    
  complication:
    purpose: "Trigger the FUNCTIONAL BREAKDOWN"
    teacher_mindset: "Your current skills/knowledge CANNOT solve this problem"
    stages:
      - "4. The Breakdown (text/audio reveals the gap)"
      - "5. Deepen the problem (show multiple conflicts or perspectives)"
      - "6. Pattern recognition (what's the common thread?)"
    key_question: "How does your current approach make you sound/look? (e.g., 'Like a robot,' 'Boring,' 'Confused')"
    
  resolution:
    purpose: "Introduce the SOLUTION STRATEGY that solves the problem"
    teacher_mindset: "Here's the skill/strategy that fixes everything. Frame it with the selected METAPHOR."
    stages:
      - "7. Apply the insight (use the new skill in realistic scenarios)"
      - "8. (Optional) Reflect on the transformation"
    key_frame: "This [skill] is your [metaphor]. It [what it does]."
    examples:
      - "Scanning is your 'Time-Saver.' It lets you find what you need in 30 seconds."
      - "Skimming is your 'Helicopter View.' It shows you the big picture without getting lost in details."

      procedure: |
        - "Here's your Time-Saver: SCANNING."
        - Teach the strategy:
          1. Ignore polite intros ("Attention passengers...")
          2. Ignore technical jargon
          3. Hunt for NUMBERS or TIME words (minutes, hours, days)
        - "Let's try it again. Find '45 minutes' in the text. How long did it take?" (10 seconds)
        - "See? You just saved 2 minutes and 50 seconds."
      time: 5
      interaction: T-Ss

          a) Scan for the KEY INFO only (time, location, yes/no)
          b) Make a decision
          c) Explain why you ignored the other words
