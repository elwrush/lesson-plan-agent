The **English Grammar Profile** is a Cambridge University Press tool that describes what grammar is typically learned at each CEFR level[7]. Here's what grammar learners master at each stage:

## A1 Level (Beginner)

At A1, learners focus on basic foundational grammar[1]:

- **Personal pronouns** (*I, he, she, it, we, you, they*)
- **Possessive pronouns** (*my, your, his, her, its, our, their*)
- **Possessive with 's** (*Paul's daughter, my sister's house*)
- **Object pronouns** (*me, you, him, her, it, us, them*)
- **Demonstrative pronouns** (*this, these, that, those*)
- **Present tenses**: Present simple and present progressive (Have got in positive, negative, and question forms)
- **Simple indefinite pronouns** (*something, anything*)

## A2 Level (Elementary)

A2 builds on A1 foundations with more complex structures[1]:

- **Articles and quantifiers**
- **Conjunctions** (*where, when, whose, why, who, that*) used in basic compound sentences (*I went out when it was raining*)

The English Grammar Profile is a free online searchable database[7] that helps teachers understand what grammar is suitable for teaching at each level and ensures curriculum design aligns with learner proficiency[3].
