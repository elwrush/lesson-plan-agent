**CEFR text characteristics vary by level, with average sentence lengths generally short at A1 (around 8-10 words) and stabilizing at 15-19 words from B1 to C2; text lengths increase at higher levels but are not reliable discriminators alone; linking words and discourse markers are not quantitatively detailed in available data but qualitatively increase in complexity and variety from basic memorized phrases at A1 to complex forms at C2.**[1][2][3][5][6]

### Average Sentence Length (in words)
Search results provide sentence-level data from large annotated corpora, showing:
- **A1**: Shortest sentences, e.g., ~8.5 words on average in one dataset; example: "She had a beautiful necklace around her neck."[3]
- **A2**: Still short, e.g., ~8.5 words; example: "Some experts say the classes should be changed."[3]
- **B1 to C2**: Longer and similar lengths (15-19 words), not significantly discriminating between levels; e.g., B1/B2/C1/C2 averages of 16.5, 15.2, 16.3, 19.2 words respectivelyΓÇöno proportional increase with level.[1][2][3]
Sentence length discriminates well at lower levels (A1-A2) but not higher (B2-C1, C1-C2).[1][2]

No exact averages across all studies due to dataset differences, but A-level sentences are consistently shorter than B/C levels.[3]

### Text Length
- Higher CEFR levels (B2-C2) correlate with longer texts overall (e.g., more words, sentences, tokens).[4][5]
- Text length alone poorly predicts level: a short complex text can exceed a long simple one.[5]
- Specific metrics: Syllables per 100 words rise modestly (A1: 137, A2: 136, B1: 136), with bigger jumps at C levels; words >2 syllables increase from ~6% (A1/A2) to higher at B2-C.[4]

### Linking Words and Discourse Markers
Quantitative data is limited; results focus on qualitative progression from CEFR descriptors:
- **A1-A2**: Basic patterns with memorized phrases, simple connectors (e.g., "and," "the," "in," "on," "so"); limited discourse initiation.[4][6]
- **B1**: More linking for general topics; some complex forms, fewer pauses in discourse.[6]
- **B2**: Higher grammatical control, complex sentences for viewpoints; metadiscourse markers increase with proficiency.[4][6]
- **C1-C2**: Advanced variety, even tempo, precise turn-taking; infrequent C-level lexis (1-2%) but biggest shifts in A2-B1 markers.[4][6]
Function words (e.g., basic linkers) stable across levels (~constant proportion).[4]

| CEFR Level | Avg. Sentence Length (words, approx.)[3] | Key Notes on Linking/Discourse[4][6] |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **A1**    | 8.5                                     | Memorized phrases, basic (and, the) |
| **A2**    | 8.5                                     | Simple everyday connectors         |
| **B1**    | 16.5                                    | Emerging complex forms             |
| **B2**    | 15.2                                    | Viewpoint linking, control         |
| **C1**    | 16.3                                    | Advanced markers, fluency          |
| **C2**    | 19.2                                    | Precise, varied discourse          |

Data gaps: No unified counts for linking words (e.g., % per text); studies prioritize lexical/syntactic over explicit discourse metrics. Sentence profiles more discriminative than text-level stats.[1][2][3]
