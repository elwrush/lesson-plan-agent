## 0. THE SKILL ACTIVATION GATE (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY task, you MUST identify the task type and read the corresponding skill file. This is non-negotiable.

| User Request | REQUIRED Skill ID | Path |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Save Work / Commit | `00-manage-git-workflow` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\00-manage-git-workflow\SKILL.md` |
| Deploy to GitHub | `00a-manage-gh-pages-workflow` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\00a-manage-gh-pages-workflow\SKILL.md` |
| Create lesson plan | `02-writing-lesson-plans` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\02-writing-lesson-plans\SKILL.md` |
| Create presentation | `06-creating-html-presentation` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\06-creating-html-presentation\SKILL.md` |
| Create worksheet/PDF | `03-producing-educational-materials` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\03-producing-educational-materials\SKILL.md` |
| Search for images | `04-searching-pixabay` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\04-searching-pixabay\SKILL.md` |
| Generate quiz | `07-generating-quizzes` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\07-generating-quizzes\SKILL.md` |
| Get transcripts | `01-grabbing-youtube-transcripts` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\01-grabbing-youtube-transcripts\SKILL.md` |
| Mermaid Diagrams | `12-rendering-prompts-into-mermaid` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\12-rendering-prompts-into-mermaid\SKILL.md` |
| Local Deployment | `09-local-server-deployment` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\09-local-server-deployment\SKILL.md` (DECOMMISSIONED) |
| Delegating Tasks | `14-delegating-to-jules` | `c:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\14-delegating-to-jules\SKILL.md` |

### The Activation Protocol

```
1. DETECT task type from user request
2. READ the corresponding SKILL.md file completely
3. ANNOUNCE: "✅ Skill loaded: [skill-name]"
4. COMPLETE .agent/workflows/task.md template
5. EXECUTE the workflow defined in .agent/workflows/agentic-flow.md
```

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL IS A CRITICAL ERROR.**

### Task Template
For complex tasks, copy `.agent/workflows/task.md` to your lesson folder and complete it as you progress.

## 1. THE PEDAGOGICAL CONSTITUTION (THE "WHY")
*   **The Roadmap First Law**: **NEVER** write code (Markdown or Typst) without first presenting a **Visual Roadmap**. 
*   **The Compartmentalization Law**: **NEVER** jump ahead to the next phase. Complete Ingestion -> Plan -> Visuals -> Code in isolation.
*   **The Source Gate**: All content must be **verbatim** from the user-provided `SOURCE_TEXT.md` and `blueprint.md`. 
    *   **User Provision**: The USER provides the `SOURCE_TEXT.md` (content) and `blueprint.md` (structure). DO NOT create `lesson_plan.typ`.
    *   **The Answering Rule**: You MUST solve all lesson tasks (Genre, Recall, Analysis, etc.) within `SOURCE_TEXT.md` using verbatim evidence before creating your Markdown presentation.
    *   **The Native Markdown Law**: You MUST write native Reveal.js Markdown (`presentation.md`). The legacy JSON pipeline is DELETED.
    *   **The Grounding Validator**: You MUST ensure your Markdown precisely maps to the source text.
    *   **The Nuke Clause**: If hallucinations are detected or validation fails, you MUST delete all lesson artifacts and restart from the `SOURCE_TEXT.md` phase.
*   **Student Voice**: Use a **Warm, Encouraging ESL Teacher Persona**. Abandon all teacher-facing labels (Gist, Lead-in, Objective). Use "Pop & Verve" student-centric language.
*   **The Bridge Slide**: Every task MUST be preceded by a `strategy` slide explaining **What**, **Why**, and **How (Tips)** using an HTML table.
*   **The Pre-Teaching Law**: Vocabulary slides (with images and phonemes) MUST appear before tasks that use them.
*   **The Segue Restriction**: Segue slides must be friendly, inviting, and use plain backgrounds (No Videos).
*   **Answer Detail Protocol**: **Strict One-Answer-Per-Slide Enforcement**. Every answer must have its own slide with a descriptive verbatim snippet preceded by a location marker (e.g., `[Para 1]`).
    *   **Exception**: Sequence/Ordering tasks MAY show the full set using `auto-animate` on the `ranking` layout.
    *   **The Sequential Reveal Law**: For error correction, you **MUST** use the `editing` layout. This layout **MUST** reveal corrections one-by-one using `auto-animate`, replacing incorrect text with bold green answers in-place.
*   **The Probe-First Table Mandate**: In pedagogical tables, always keep the first column (Categories/Questions) visible on landing. **NEVER** hide the entire row. Apply `fragment` animation only to the specific answer cells.
*   **Dual Coding**: Pair all key text with relevant FontAwesome icons. **NEVER** use plain bullets or carats. **MANDATORY**: Use standard FontAwesome tags (e.g., `<i class="fas fa-..."></i>`). **NEVER** use raw hex codes (e.g., `&#xf002;`) as they are non-deterministic without font-family overrides.
*   **The Green Glow Standard**: All question/task slides MUST use the green radial glow design instead of image backgrounds.
*   **Cognitive Load**:
    *   **Rule of 3 Lines**: Max 3-5 significant items per slide.
    *   **7-Second Rule**: Background videos must be ambient (7s loop), not distracting.
    *   **The 16:9 Standard**: Presentations MUST initialize with a **1280x720** (16:9) aspect ratio and a `margin: 0.05` to ensure optimal font scaling and readability.

## 2. THE DESIGN SYSTEM (UI SHORTCODES)

| Component | Layout ID | Context |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mission Slide** | `mission` | Objectives with horizontally stacked badges. |
| **Schema Activation** | `schema_activation` | Visual-only lead-in with icons and bright background. |
| **Strategy Bridge** | `strategy` | Pre-task instructions in a stylized table. |
| **Ranking/Ordering** | `ranking` | Height-matched bars with `auto-animate` sorting. |
| **Answer Reveal** | `answer_detail` | Single answer with evidence snippet and explanation. |
| **Vocabulary Card** | `vocab` | Image + Phoneme + Context sentence (labeled "Context"). |
| **Interactive Editing**| `editing` | Auto-animating word replacement (Green). Replaces `cross_out`. |
| **Listening Deck** | `audio_experience`| Immersive audio player with custom background support. |

## 3. REPOSITORY HYGIENE (THE IRON LAWS)

### A. Asset Management
*   **The 1MB Rule**: All local images MUST be under 1MB. The build system automatically resizes images > 1920px.
*   **Bundled Pathing Strategy**:
    1.  **Uniform Relative Paths**: ALWAYS use relative paths (`images/filename.ext`) in JSON and templates.
    2.  **Automatic Resolution**: The build system (`generate_presentation.py`) automatically copies shared media from root `/images/` into the local bundle.
*   **Self-Containment**: Every presentation in `published/` MUST be a standalone bundle containing its own `dist/`, `plugin/`, `fontawesome/`, and `images/` folders.
*   **Zero Duplication**: NEVER commit the same binary to both `inputs/` and `dist/`.

### B. Engineering Standards
*   **Standalone Build**: Use `build.py` (Python) for processing. HTML is the sole presentation format. PowerPoint (PPTX) is decommissioned.
*   **Deterministic Validation**: Run `.gemini/hooks/present-validator.py` before finishing. It enforces hygiene, answer separation, and verbatim alignment.
*   **Single-Header Policy**: Use **Pipes** (`|`) to combine titles and sub-instructions. Never use two header tags (h1/h2) on one slide.

## 4. CRITICAL WORKFLOWS

### A. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```powershell
python build.py [lesson-name]
python skills/deploying-to-github-pages/scripts/deploy_presentation.py [lesson-name]
```
**CRITICAL**: Presentations are now **fully self-contained bundles**. The deployment script copies the entire lesson folder (including its own Reveal engine, FontAwesome library, and media) to `gh-pages`. This ensures 100% reliability and portability.
