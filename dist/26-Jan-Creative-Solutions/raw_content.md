**Intro:** Many cities have traffic problems, but not at all solutions are the same.

**City 1 (Curitiba, Brazil):**
Over 40 years ago, one city in Brazil made one quick and important decision to reduce the number of cars. In just 72 hours, Curitiba turned its main business street into a pedestrian street. At first the project was not popular, but over time people saw it as positive. The city later made 52 other roads pedestrian-only. People are using these areas for outdoor markets, concerts, and other events. The city has 16 parks and over a thousand green spaces. In 1970, each person had one square meter of green space, but today they have 52. It is clear the city is working hard to save its natural environment and Curitiba is a great example of pedestrian-friendly city planning.

**City 2 (Murcia, Spain):**
In Murcia, a city in Spain, you can give your car to the city government if you don't want to use it. The idea is to get more public transportation in the city, and less car traffic. The city wants people to use its new, greener trams. When they exchange their car, they get a free lifetime pass to use on any tram. Murcia is using its old cars in art projects around the city. The city wants to show the bad side of cars and the challenges of parking. Sometimes the art pieces they display show cars on top of each other.

**City 3 (La Paz, Bolivia):**
La Paz, Bolivia, is one of the highest cities in the world, and it has some of the worst traffic. There are not enough vans to move passengers and the buses are often full. For the people who travel downtown from El Alto, a neighborhood up on a mountain, the trip is long, crowded, and tiring. But a new cable car is making the trip easier. It is cutting travel time to just minutes while it saves many people over an hour of travel time each day. People go to and from downtown, high above the traffic. There is hope that the new cable car will reduce the number of cars on the road as well as reduce air pollution.
