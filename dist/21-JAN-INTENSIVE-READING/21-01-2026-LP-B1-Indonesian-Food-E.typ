  This lesson utilizes the *B1 Intensive Reading* material. For stronger learners, encourage them to provide textual evidence for their Task 3 (True/False) answers. For emerging learners, the pre-teaching stage focused on "Blocking Vocabulary" (Krashen, 1982) ensures the core text remains accessible without constant dictionary dependence.

      - **Video Opener**: Play YouTube Short (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MCOnsoZRUMw) of frogs being cooked in an Indonesian market. *Note: Do not loop.*
      - **Discussion**: Elicit the country (Indonesia) and ask: "Do you think this is disgusting?", "Why?". Brainstorm why people in different countries might eat different things (Availability, culture, climate).
      - **Vocabulary Pre-teach**: Present 5 blocking words using the context sentences and Thai translations provided below:
        1. **domestic** /dəˈmes.tɪk/: _Most of the rice is grown for domestic use, not for export._ (ภายในประเทศ)
        2. **producer** /prəˈdʒuː.sər/: _Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers of palm oil._ (ผู้ผลิต)
        3. **urban** /ˈɜː.bən/: _Many people are moving from farms to urban areas like Jakarta._ (ในเมือง)
        4. **processed** /ˈprəʊ.sest/: _Supermarkets sell more processed foods like canned soup._ (ที่ผ่านกระบวนการ)
        5. **challenge** /ˈtʃæl.ɪndʒ/: _The increasing population is a major challenge for the food industry._ (ความท้าทาย)

      - **Task 1: Before you Read**: Ss look at the heading and the "picture on the screen" (from lead-in) to predict the text's purpose. Discuss in pairs.
      - **Task 2: Global Reading**:
        - Part 1: Ss skim the text to check mentioned topics (Checklist). Clear the concepts of "Global" reading—ignoring difficult words to find the main "Dashes" (details).
        - Part 2: Ss use their checklist answers to complete the summary paragraph. Peer check.
      - **Task 3: Close Reading**: Ss read the text for detail to answer True/False/Not Given questions. Encourage Ss to underline where they found the answer in the text.
      - **Feedback**: Project the text and have Ss identify the specific sentences that prove or disprove the Task 3 items.

      - **Task 4: Critical Thinking**: Ss work in groups to discuss two key questions:
        1. Changes in diet in Indonesia vs. their own country.
        2. The rise of processed foods and its health impacts.
      - **McKinsey Logic**: Frame the discussion around the "Complication" of modernization—as countries get richer (Indonesia/Thailand), health challenges increase.
      - **Feedback**: Groups share one "Insight" or comparison they discovered about their own country's food trends.
