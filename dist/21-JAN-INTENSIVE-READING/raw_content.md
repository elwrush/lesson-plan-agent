# The food of Indonesia

1. Situated in a warm, tropical region, Indonesia has a lot of rain and sunshine and therefore has the perfect climate for a long growing season. The country also has large areas of good-quality soil. Both factors make Indonesia an excellent region for a successful farming economy. A large percentage of the population works in the farming industry and the country gets a lot of income from this. There is a large range of farms, but most belong to three types: small farms growing rice for domestic use, small farms growing crops for export, and large, foreign-owned or privately-owned farms that also mostly export food.

2. Indonesia's climate makes it ideal for planting and growing most popular crops. Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers of many different kinds of food. It is a known producer of palm oil and spices like cloves and cinnamon. It is also one of the biggest producers of other key foods consumers frequently buy such as cocoa, coffee, and tea. Growing plants to eat is obviously important, yet many farmers also plant other crops of high value such as natural rubber.

3. The farming industry is clearly important for the country's economy, however, it has also influenced the local food culture and customs. Indonesia has a long history of cooking with herbs and spices. The Betawi, who are a local group in the region of Jakarta, are responsible for many of the street foods. Kerak Telor, which is possibly their most famous dish, is made of rice, coconut, onions, shrimp, and egg and fried into a cake. With thousands of street food stalls selling dishes for under one U.S. dollar they form an important part of the economy.

4. As Indonesia has become richer and more urban the local diets have gradually changed. In particular, the amount of dairy, meat, and sugar people eat has grown. Many of these products and other processed foods and drink are often imported. A lot of people still prefer to shop in traditional local stores for their groceries, but supermarkets are selling an increasing amount of food to urban people. These stores mostly sell processed foods and often have better refrigerators to keep the dairy and meat products people demand.


5. As lifestyles and diets change there are many challenges facing the Indonesian food industry. In the past, the country produced enough rice and sugar for everyone, but now it needs to import these foods. An increasing population, more land being used for crops people do not eat, and growing industries are all placing pressure on the future of food in Indonesia.
