## 2026-01-14 | Presentation Physics Overhaul & Visual Workflow

### Key Technical Achievement: "Fixed Canvas Logic"
- **Problem**: Fluid/Responsive layouts (`height: 100%`) caused content to overflow or disappear on large screens ("Webpage Logic").
- **Solution**: Adopted **Fixed Artboard Logic** (960x700px).
  - Explicit pixel heights for rows (`500px`).
  - Strict `max-height: 400px` for all media.
  - Floating "Cyber Pill" header (`absolute`, `z-index: 10`) to remove layout impact.
  - **Result**: Perfect deployment on Cloudflare (Desktop & Mobile).

### Workflow Pivot: The "Visual First" Standard
- **Change**: Moved from "Code-First" (writing HTML directly) to a **5-Step Gated Workflow**.
  1.  **Theme Selection**: Dynamic choice (Cyber, Noir, Minimal).
  2.  **Visual Plan (Markdown)**: Descriptive planning of visuals with pedagogical intent.
  3.  **User Approval**: Explicit "Stop & Check."
  4.  **Wireframe**: Canvas logic mapping (Mermaid).
  5.  **Implementation**: Copying the Gold Standard `REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.html`.

### Pedagogical Upgrades
- **Source Sync**: Slides must strictly match Worksheet task names (e.g., "TASK 2").
- **Answer Keys**: Enforced "Single Answer Interleaving" (One answer per slide, immediately following question, with 'Why' explanation).
- **Voice**: "Pop & Verve" tone mandated (e.g., "YOUR MISSION" instead of "Task").
- **Infographics**: Prioritized **Generative AI** for "Pop" visuals; restricted Mermaid to technical data.

### Feature Addition: TTS Vocabulary Audio
- **Requirement**: "Direct Vocabulary" slides must include audio pronunciation context.
- **Engine**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview TTS**.
- **Implementation**:
  - Script: `skills/creating-html-presentation/scripts/generate_vocab_audio.py`
  - Output: `.wav` files in `images/audio/`
  - UI: Stylized "Cyber" audio player with "Listen!" label.

### Skill Upgrade
- **`creating-html-presentation`**: Fully rewritten to version 2.3.
- **Reference**: `REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.html` created and updated with new CSS (`.audio-player`).

## 2026-01-15 | Worksheet Graphics & Layout Refinement

### Visual Upgrade: "Transparent Layouts" & "Defined Motifs"
- **Goal**: Move away from blocky, whitespace-heavy images to integrated layouts.
- **Action**:
  -   **Trimming**: Implemented `trim_image.py` to auto-crop whitespace from generated assets.
  -   **Transparency**: Enforced transparent PNGs for all non-rectangular motifs.
  -   **Separators**: Standardized on "Wide Trimmed" motifs (e.g., EKG line) for section breaks.

### Usability: "The Handwriting Standard"
- **Problem**: Previous templates ignored physical space needed for handwriting.
- **Solution**:
  -   **Writing Tasks**: Dedicated page, Grouped Prompts, 10 Double-Spaced Lines (Dark Gray).
  -   **Definitions**: `Word: ____________` layout (Auto + 1fr Line) with 1.5cm spacing.
  -   **Matching**: Minimum 1cm gap between items.

### Layout: "Booklet Safety"
- **Constraint**: Printing on A3 folded (Booklet).
- **Rule**: Content must never split across the "Page 4 -> 5" boundary (Sheet transition).
- **Implementation**: Strict manual page breaks enforced at these boundaries to keep Tasks self-contained on a physical sheet.

### Skill Update
-   **`developing-bespoke-materials`**: Updated with strict rules for Pagination, Image Quality, and Handwriting Spacing.
-   **`processing-images`**: Created new skill for image hygiene.

## 2026-01-15 (Midday) | Typst-Only Workflow & HTML Decommissioning

### Key Technical Achievement: Typst Standardization
- **Pivot**: Successfully completed transition to **100% Typst-only** workflow for professional PDF lesson plans.
- **Decommissioning**: Fully removed legacy HTML-to-GDocs pipelines, WeasyPrint-related scripts, and the `pushing-to-gdocs` skill.
- **Centralization**: All lesson plan UI components (Headers, Metadata, Stage Tables) now live in a single library: `skills/writing-lesson-plans/templates/lesson-plan-components.typ`.

### Workflow Optimization: "The Orphan Fix"
- **Standard**: Implemented a mandatory "Self-Audit for Orphans" in the workflow.
- **Implementation**: If a Stage Heading is orphaned, the `stage_table` is split into two blocks with a manual `#pagebreak()` in between.
- **Validation**: Updated `validate_lesson_plan.py` to be 100% Typst-focused (removing HTML parsing logic).

### Branding & Pedagogy
- **Naming**: Formally adopted **"Differentiated Input"** as the standard terminology for student text choice, replacing "Optimal Input".
- **Density**: Validated "Fight or Flight" (Shape E) for detail density against the model YAML, ensuring procedures are "thick" and professional.
- **Ethics**: Implemented strict rules against **"Dojo Rewards"** (Intrinsic motivation only) and **"Hallucinated Assets"** (Lesson plans must only reference existing files).

### Housekeeping: Decommissioning
- **Action**: Deleted `design-slides` workflow and confirmed removal of legacy `designing-slides` skill artifacts. This is replaced by the modern `creating-html-presentation` standard.

---

## 2026-01-15 (Afternoon) | Presentation Workflow Violations Identified

### Critical Issue: Skill Non-Compliance
- **Problem**: During creation of "Relative Clauses" presentation, multiple violations of the `creating-html-presentation` skill workflow were identified.
- **Root Cause**: Agent did not strictly follow the 5-step gated workflow defined in `skills/creating-html-presentation/SKILL.md`.

### Violations Detected:
1. **Missing Answer Slides**: Initial version did not include answer key slides (required by pedagogical standards).
2. **Content Overflow**: Font sizes too large, causing text to overflow slide boundaries (violated Fixed Canvas Logic).
3. **Incomplete Interleaving**: Answers were not properly interleaved after each task slide.

### Corrective Actions Taken:
- Added 3 answer key slides (Task 1, 2, 3 answers).
- Reduced font sizes across all slides for proper fit within 960x700 canvas.
- Compressed table layouts and shortened text where necessary.

### Mandatory Reminder for Future# Session Log - January 20, 2026

**Objective**: B1 Story Writing Presentation - Visual & Architectural Refinement.

- **Architectural**: Updated `creating-html-presentation` skill to enforce 1100px width and 18pt minimum font sizes globally.
- **Refinement**: Switched from 640px to 1280px "Blackboard" texture for crisp background display.
- **UX**: Improved Auto-Animate word upgrades with "Level Up" badges and scaling.
- **Layout**: Implemented 35/65 split ratios to prevent text overflow in glass boxes.
- **Glow System**: Replaced boxy shadows with soft radial atmospheric light layers.
- **Media**: Reverted Boss Level video to standard segue per user instruction for flow reliability.

## Previous Sessions
⚠️ **ALWAYS REVIEW `skills/creating-html-presentation/SKILL.md` BEFORE CREATING PRESENTATIONS**
- The skill contains critical workflow gates and quality standards.
- Do NOT skip the Visual Plan approval step.
- Do NOT assume answer slides are optional.
- Do NOT use fluid layouts or percentage-based heights.

### Action Item:
- Future agents must explicitly confirm they have read the skill file before proceeding with presentation creation.

## 2026-01-16 | Full Skill Audit & Global Documentation Skills

### Major Achievement: Project-Wide Skill Compliance Audit
- **Action**: Evaluated all 8 project skills against `knowledge_base/using-skills.md` standards.
- **Result**: All skills now fully compliant with:
  - YAML frontmatter (name + description)
  - Third-person descriptions
  - Gerund naming convention
  - Deterministic validator scripts
  - Explicit workflow gates

### Skills Fixed:
| Skill | Issue | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `generating-worksheets` | Missing Bell/Intensive header logic | Added Step 0 context check + Intensive template |
| `using-meander` | No fallback strategy | Added Troubleshooting + Fallback sections |
| `hosting-presentations` | Missing YAML frontmatter | Added frontmatter, fixed naming mismatch |
| `writing-lesson-plans` | Validator not mandated | Added Step 9: Validate (MANDATORY) |
| `developing-bespoke-materials` | No validation step | Added Step 5.5 delegating to child validators |

### Deleted:
- `writing-bespoke-materials` (legacy HTML/WeasyPrint sub-skill) — superseded by parent skill.

### New Global Skills Created:
1. **`fetching-docs-context7`**: Retrieves LLM-optimized documentation from Context7 API.
2. **`crawling-official-docs`**: Scrapes official doc sites via Firecrawl API.

### Global Skill Validator Updated:
- Added `fetching-` and `crawling-` to recognized gerund patterns.
- All new skills validated and passing.

## 2026-01-16 (Afternoon) | Interactive Audio Timers & Web Component Architecture

### Key Technical Achievement: Immersive Audio Feedback
- **Problem**: Classroom timers were purely visual, requiring constant teacher monitoring.
- **Solution**: Integrated a synchronized audio feedback system:
  - **`blip.mp3`**: Rhythmic tick every second for urgency.
  - **`30-seconds.mp3`**: Voice warning at the wrap-up mark.
  - **`bell.mp3`**: Deep meditation chime for task completion.
- **Implementation**: Global audio singletons for performance, synchronized with the timer heartbeat.

### Architectural Pivot: Native Web Components (`<timer-pill>`)
- **Problem**: Legacy `initTimers` procedural logic was verbose (40+ lines of HTML per slide) and prone to initialization errors.
- **Solution**: Refactored the timer into a **Native Web Component** (`TimerPill`).
- **Impact**:
  - **Declarative Syntax**: `<timer-pill duration="5"></timer-pill>` replaces complex nested divs.
  - **Encapsulated Logic**: State, audio, and display are self-managed within the component class.
  - **Code Reduction**: **97.5% reduction** in per-slide HTML boilerplate.

### Modular Documentation & Quality Control
- **Created `COMPONENTS.md`**: Single source of truth for 20+ documented CSS classes and components.
- **Created `DECISION_TREE.md`**: Logic gates for implementation decisions (Text vs. Image vs. Layout).
- **Established `docs/` Folder**: Curated Reveal.js documentation for Layout and Backgrounds.
- **Workflow Update**: Step 5 now mandates "Required Reading" of these new resources to prevent common errors (font overflow, class misuse).

### Validator Upgrade: "The Enforcement Layer"
- **Enhancement**: Substantial upgrades to `validate_presentation.py`:
  - Enforces `.inset-media` or `.constrained-media` on all images.
  - Mandates `.slide-canvas` wrapper for layout stability.
  - Verifies audio dependencies (`audio/*.mp3`) for timer functionality.
  - Checks for "Answer Interleaving" (Answer slide must follow Task slide within 3 slides).
  - Detects missing timers on task-bearing slides.

### Strategic Evaluation: Vanilla vs. React
- **Action**: Evaluated Reach-based wrappers (`revealjs-react`, etc.) vs. the current Native Web Component approach.
- **Decision**: **STAY WITH VANILLA/NATIVE**.
- **Reasoning**:
  - Native Components provide 90% of React's DX (declarative tags) with **0% build overhead**.
  - No `node_modules` or build pipeline required for teachers to preview slides.
  - Simpler for LLM agents to generate correct, valid HTML.

### Compliance & Pedagogical Strengthening
- **Gate 2 Fix**: Added explicit **STOP AND WAIT** command for Audience selection (Middle vs. High School).
- **Tone Standardization**: Added a "Tone Comparison Table" showing exactly how slide titles, instructions, and motivation differ between audiences.
- **Result**: Auditor confirmed the skill is now **100% compliant** with the Antigravity Skills standard.

### Audit Result:
- **Presentation Verified**: `18-Jan-Reading/index.html` was audited using the new validator. It identified 21 critical issues, validating the power of the new enforcement system.

### Decommissioning: Branding Logos
- **Action**: Fully removed all Bell/Intensive logo logic from `SKILL.md` and `validate_presentation.py`.
- **Reason**: User requirement—"These slides should not have a Bell logo [or Intensive logo] at all, ever."
- **Status**: Presentations are now 100% unbranded/clean by default.


### 2026-01-18: Presentation Deployment Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: "Global Logistics" presentation deployment failed to load external `slide-components.js` due to path resolution errors and Cloudflare MIME type mismatches (returning 404 HTML for JS files).
- **Attempted Fixes**:
    - Corrected relative paths (`../skills/...`).
    - Moved script to root (`/js/slide-components.js`) and used absolute paths.
    - **Inlined JavaScript directly into `index.html`** (Best Practice for reliability).
    - Created `live.html` to bypass potential browser caching.
- **Deployment Failure**: Initial git push triggered "Asset too large" error (uploading `.git` folder).
- **Resolution**:
    - **Architecture**: Implemented a **"Whitelist Build Strategy"**.
    - **Script**: `scripts/build_dist.js` now builds a clean `dist/` folder containing *only* the specific presentation content and shared assets.
    - **CI**: Configured `package.json` (`postinstall`) and `wrangler.jsonc` to deploy this clean `dist/` folder.
- **Status**: **SUCCESS**. Presentation is live and fully functional at the worker URL.

### 2026-01-18 (Continued): Worksheet Fixes
- **Issue 1**: Intensive worksheets displayed legacy text strap instead of the mandatory `intensive-header.jpg`.
- **Fix 1**: Updated `intensive_worksheet_template.typ` and `15-01-26...Intensive.typ` to use the image header. Updated `generating-worksheets` skill to forbid text straps.
- **Issue 2**: Excessive whitespace on Page 2 due to aggressive `#pagebreak()` after Task 1.
- **Fix 2**: Removed forced page break. Verified cleaner layout.
- **Feature**: Added modular `#gapfill_exercise` component to template.
- **Fix 3**: Replaced text gaps in Task 2 with physical writing lines using the new component. Verified PDF.
- **Housekeeping**: Moved misplaced "Fight or Flight" Lesson Plan and Worksheet source (`.typ`) to `inputs/QAD-Fight-or-Flight` for consolidation.

---

## 2026-01-18 (Evening) | The "Fight or Flight" Deployment Crisis (RCA)

### Post-Mortem: "The Sprinter Ghost"
- **Issue**: Deploying the "Fight or Flight" presentation consistently served a legacy "Sprinter" theme (Maroon/Yellow) instead of the approved "Red Alert" (Cyber/Red) version.
- **Root Cause**: A perfect storm of **Path Collision** and **Cache Persistence**.
  -   The deployment pipeline was building from `presentations/18-01-26_Fight-or-Flight/`, which contained an older project version.
  -   Even after local `dist/` updates, Cloudflare Pages continued to serve the cached athlete visual.
  -   Agent confusion: Multiple copies of `index.html` existed in `inputs/`, `presentations/`, and the root, leading to "Whack-a-Mole" updates where the wrong source was repeatedly promoted.

### Failed Interventions:
1.  **Direct Overwrite**: Overwrote `dist/` and `presentations/` files - **FAILED** (Cache held old assets).
2.  **`build_dist.js` Logic**: Forced the script to pull from `inputs/QAD-Fight-or-Flight` - **FAILED** (Deployment still showed Sprinter).
3.  **Manual Header Check**: Added `v1.txt` marker - **FAILED** (404/Index redirect obscured verification).

### Corrective Strategy: "The Cache-Buster Pivot"
- **Action**: Abandoned the legacy path entirely.
- **Implementation**:
  -   Created a new, unique deployment path: `/red-alert-slides/`.
  -   Updated `build_dist.js` to target this unique folder name.
  -   Updated `link.html` and the global `presentations/index.html` to point to the new URL.
- **Strict Verification**: Mandated a manual check of `images/brain_alarm.png` existence within the build script before allowing the push.

### Status:
-   **RESOLVED**: See 2026-01-18 (Morning) below.

---

## 2026-01-18 (Morning) | Deployment Architecture Overhaul

### Key Achievement: Consolidated Deployment Pipeline
- **Problem**: Multiple copies of presentations scattered across project root, causing "Sprinter Ghost" deployment bugs.
- **Solution**: Established **single source of truth** architecture:
  1. All presentation files must live in `inputs/[QAD-folder]/` alongside lesson plan and worksheet.
  2. Deleted duplicate folders: `18-01-26_Fight-or-Flight/`, `slideshow-fight-or-flight/`, `presentations/18-01-26_Fight-or-Flight/`.
  3. Updated `creating-html-presentation` skill with **mandatory co-location rule**.

### Build Script Modernization
- **Before**: `build_dist.js` had hardcoded presentation paths.
- **After**: CLI-based invocation: `node scripts/build_dist.js <folder-name>`
  - Validates source exists in `inputs/`
  - Lists available folders if no argument provided
  - Checks for required files before completing

### Cloudflare API Token Setup
- **Issue**: Wrangler OAuth failed in headless environment; existing token lacked Pages permissions.
- **Solution**: Created new token with correct permissions:
  - Permission: **Account > Cloudflare Pages > Edit**
  - Account Resources: **Specific account** (not "All accounts")
  - Stored in `CLOUDFLARE_SLIDESHOW_API` User environment variable

### Deployment Projects
| Project | URL | Method |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `lesson-slideshows` | lesson-slideshows.pages.dev | Direct Wrangler deploy |
| `lesson-plan-agent` | lesson-plan-agent.pages.dev | Git-connected CI deploy |

### Skill Updates
- **`hosting-presentations`**: Completely rewritten for direct Wrangler deployment with API token.
- **`creating-html-presentation`**: Added mandatory co-location rule at top of SKILL.md.

### Live URLs
- **Fight or Flight Slideshow**: https://lesson-slideshows.pages.dev
- **Presentations Dashboard**: https://lesson-plan-agent.pages.dev/presentations/

## 2026-01-18 (Midday) | Business Vocabulary: The Editorial Shift

### Key Achievement: "Creative Editorial" Paradigm
- **Problem**: Standard modular worksheets looked "poxy" and wasted whitespace, leading to 5+ page documents.
- **Solution**: Shifted to a **Creative Editorial** (Magazine-style) approach:
  - **High-Density Grids**: Switched from 1-column to 2-column grids for reading and exercises.
  - **Cinematic Headers**: Full-width graphical banners with text overlays replaced blocky logos and titles, saving significant vertical space.
  - **Immersive Frames**: Used specific UI metaphors (e.g., "Tablet UI" for financial text) to organize content thematically.
- **Result**: Compact, professional 4+1 booklet layout that feels like a premium educational magazine.

### Technical Refinement: Robust Handwriting Components
- **Gap Fills**: Standardization of `#box`-based gap fills over legacy underscores to prevent Typst syntax errors.
- **Padding Control**: Established **0.85cm** as the optimal vertical padding for handwriting lines in high-density layouts.
- **Visibility**: Enforced **#404040** (Dark Grey) dotted lines to survive the "Photocopier Test."

### Skill Evolution: `developing-bespoke-materials` V3
- **Integrated Learnings**: The skill now mandates:
  1. **Strict Source Verification** to prevent factual hallucinations during text transformations.
  2. **Editorial Logic Gates**—evaluating "Density" and "Visual Metaphor" before coding.
  3. **Standardized Typst Technicals** (Rules for `box` lines, padding, and leading).

### Validation & Cleanup
- **Script Update**: Updated `validate_lesson_plan.py` to remove the mandatory Thai scaffolding check.
- **Compliance**: All files (Worksheet, Lesson Plan, and Script) validated and passing for **Ed Rush (Bell)**.


---

## 2026-01-18 (Evening) | Multi-Presentation Deployment Architecture

### Key Achievement: "Zero Overwrite" Architecture
- **Problem**: Deployments to the root of `lesson-slideshows.pages.dev` caused each new presentation to overwrite the previous one.
- **Solution**: Refactored `build_dist.js` to a **Subfolder Whitelist Strategy**:
  - Automatically scans `inputs/` for all valid presentations.
  - Builds each into its own unique directory in `dist/` (e.g., `/dist/QAD-Fight-or-Flight/`).
  - Generates a central **Bell Presentations Library** dashboard at the root.
- **Impact**: All presentations are now hosted simultaneously at stable, unique URLs.

### Fix: "Fight or Flight" Link Restoration
- **Action**: Identified that legacy Google Doc links were pointing to the root or abandoned folders.
- **Resolution**: Created a new stable Google Doc link for "Fight or Flight" pointing to its dedicated subfolder.
- **New URL**: `https://lesson-slideshows.pages.dev/QAD-Fight-or-Flight/`

### Skill Consolidation
- **`hosting-presentations`**: Updated to version 3.0, mandating the subfolder build strategy and dashboard generation.

### Future Action Item
- **Update All Slideshow Links**: In the next lesson, all legacy Google Doc links and worksheet "link.html" references must be updated to point to the new unique subfolder URLs (e.g., `https://lesson-slideshows.pages.dev/[lesson-folder]/`) to ensure stability.


## 2026-01-19 (Morning) | Business Empires Slideshow Construction

### Key Achievement: Batch-Built 63-Slide Presentation
- **Problem**: Large 56-slide visual plan exceeded token limits for single-file generation.
- **Solution**: Implemented a **3-Batch Construction Workflow**:
  1. Base Structure + Slides 1-17 (Lead-in, Gist).
  2. Slides 18-38 (Vocab Tasks 2 & 3).
  3. Slides 39-63 (Auto-Animate Transformations & Boss Level).

### Feature Implementation: "Gold Standard" Mechanics
- **Auto-Animate**: Applied strictly for Grammar Transformations (Task 4), splitting 7 questions into 14 paired slides (Question -> Answer) to visualize the text change.
- **Speaker Notes**: Mandatory `<aside class="notes">` block added to **100% of slides** (verified by pedagogical validator).
- **Audio Feedback**: Incorporated `timer-pill` (with blip/bell sfx) on all task slides.

### Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Technical Validation**:
  - Initial run flagged 36 internal CSS font-size violations.
  - **Fix**: Replaced inline `style="font-size:..."` with utility classes (`.text-2xl`, `.text-3xl`).
  - **Result**: 0 Critical Issues.
- **Corruption Repair**: Detected and fixed a content paste error in Slide 16 (Task 1 Answers) where checklist items overwrote the answer key.
- **Pedagogical Validation**: Passed 100%.

### Status
- **Ready**: `inputs/20-JAN-A-CLASS-VOCAB/index.html` is production-ready.

### Visual Refinement Phase (Iterative Polish)
- **Layout Logic**: Pivot to **Split Layout (50/50)** for all Task Instructions and Reading Slides to improve information density and visual balance.
- **Asset Generation**: Created custom AI imagery for specific contexts:
  - *Title*: Holographic Global Empire.
  - *Task 1*: Diverse Business Meeting.
  - *Task 2*: Contract Signing Close-up.
  - *Reading*: Rustic Bakery Storefront & Baker Kneading.
- **Correction**: Moved "Expand" visualization to the introductory vocabulary slide for better pedagogical flow.

---

## 2026-01-20 | Quality Assurance & Repair Queue

### Repair Work Required: Appositives Slideshow
- **Issue**: User reported hallucinated material in `inputs/19-Jan-2026-Appositives` slideshow; content does not correspond with the worksheet.
- **Action Required**: Undertake repair work immediately upon next logon.
- **Status**: Pending.

---

## 2026-01-21 | CA Writing Worksheet Crisis (Typst Pagination)

### Critical Issue: Uncontrollable Page Spillover
- **Context**: Creating a simple 3-page CA Writing worksheet for B1/B2 articles.
- **Requirements**:
  - Page 1: B1 task (header, prompt, student info line, ruled lines) - **must fit on ONE page**
  - Page 2: B2 task (header, prompt, student info line, ruled lines)
  - Page 3: B2 continuation (full page of ruled lines)

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cumulative Spacing**: Multiple `v()` calls, paragraph spacing (`par.spacing`), and `line()` elements compound unpredictably.
2. **1.5em Line Spacing**: Using relative units (`em`) instead of absolute units makes total height unpredictable.
3. **No Typst Page Bounds Query**: Cannot programmatically ask "how much space is left on this page?"
4. **Trial-and-Error Approach**: Kept adjusting line counts blindly without measuring actual content height.

### Failed Approaches
| Attempt | Problem |
|:---|:---|
| `tiling`/`pattern` for ruled lines | Typst tiling requires absolute units, not percentages; also deprecated to `tiling` |
| 22 lines → 14 lines → 12 lines | Still spilling; never calculated actual space used by headers |
| Reducing margins and fonts | Broke visual formatting, made lines too cramped for handwriting |
| Multiple full rewrites | Each introduced new formatting regressions |

### Correct Approach (To Apply After Restart)
1. **Calculate Available Height Precisely**:
   - A4 = 297mm
   - Margins: top 1.5cm + bottom 2cm = 3.5cm = 35mm
   - Usable: 262mm
   
2. **Measure Header + Content Block**:
   - Header bar: ~15mm
   - Maroon underline + spacing: ~8mm
   - Title block: ~15mm
   - Task text (3-4 lines): ~40mm
   - Student info: ~8mm
   - "Your Article:" label: ~6mm
   - **Total fixed content: ~92mm**
   - **Remaining for lines: 170mm**

3. **Calculate Line Count**:
   - At 7mm per line (good for handwriting): 170 / 7 = **24 lines maximum** for task pages
   - Full continuation page: 262 / 7 = **37 lines maximum**

4. **Use Absolute Units**:
   - Replace `v(1.5em)` with `v(7mm)` for predictable spacing
   - Test with **18 lines** on task pages (conservative buffer)
   - Test with **34 lines** on continuation page

### Key File
- `inputs/21-Jan-CA-Writing-Task-2a/22-01-2026-B1-B2-Articles-CA-Writing.typ`

### Lesson Learned
- **Never guess line counts** - calculate from page dimensions
- **Use absolute units** (mm, cm, pt) not relative (em, %)
- **Test compile after EVERY change** - don't batch multiple adjustments
- **Preserve working formatting** - when fixing pagination, don't touch fonts/margins/spacing simultaneously

## 2026-01-21 | Typst Dynamic Space-Filling, Appositives Repair & Skill Architecture Fixes

### Key Technical Achievement: Context-Aware Line Filling
- **Problem**: Manual line counting (`for i in range(N)`) caused spillover when headers changed size. Printing 2-up (A5 effective) made fixed spacing too cramped for handwriting.
- **Solution**: Implemented **Typst Context System** for dynamic space calculation:
  ```typst
  #context {
    let current-pos = here().position()
    let available = page.height - page.margin.bottom - current-pos.y
    fill-space-with-lines(available - 0.5cm)
  }
  ```
- **2-Up Print Rule**: Use **1.1cm** line spacing. When scaled 2-up on A4, this becomes ~7.8mm (optimal for handwriting).
- **Result**: "Orphan-proof" worksheets that perfectly fill every page regardless of header size.

### Skill & Template Updates
- **`generating-worksheets/SKILL.md`**: Added dynamic space-filling logic to Design Standards.
- **`knowledge_base/templates/grammar_repair_worksheet_gold.typ`**: Refactored to use `#writing_lines_dynamic()`.
- **`errors-fix.md`**: Documented breakthrough under "Dynamic Space-Filling (Typst 0.11+)".

### Appositives Slideshow Repair
- **Issue**: Slideshow contained hallucinated content not matching worksheet.
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Task 1: Fixed 4 answers to match worksheet exactly
  - Task 2: Replaced 3 hallucinated answers with correct 7 answers
- **Deployment**: `https://lesson-slideshows.pages.dev/19-Jan-2026-Appositives/`

### Critical Slideshow Architecture Fixes

#### Issue 1: Content Hallucination/Truncation
- **Root Cause**: No verification step. Agent reads worksheet once, generates from memory.
- **Fix**: Added **Step 0.6: Source Content Extraction Gate** to `creating-html-presentation/SKILL.md`
  1. Agent extracts ALL content from worksheet into a checklist BEFORE coding
  2. Presents count for user verification ("X tasks, Y questions")
  3. After coding, every checkbox must be ticked
- **Template**: Added Content Checklist Template to `REFERENCE.md`

#### Issue 2: Vertical Stacking Causes Hidden Content
- **Problem**: Slides stack content top-to-bottom in narrow columns, hiding timers below 700px canvas.
- **Fix**: Added **HORIZONTAL-FIRST LAYOUT RULE** to skill
  - Task slides MUST use `.row-container` with 50/50 splits
  - Glass boxes must be 700-800px wide minimum
  - Pre-Build Checklist for visual verification
- **Patterns**: Added to `REFERENCE.md` → "Horizontal Layout Patterns"

### Skill Compliance Refactoring
- **Problem**: `creating-html-presentation/SKILL.md` had 536 lines (limit: 500)
- **Action**: Moved heavy code examples to `REFERENCE.md`:
  - Content Checklist Template
  - Auto-Animate patterns
  - Horizontal Layout patterns (banned/required)
- **Result**: 492 lines - **PASSED** validator

### Known Issues (Deferred)
- **Dashboard Broken Links**: Clicking cards on `lesson-slideshows.pages.dev` causes recursive URL appending. Direct links unaffected. Fix later in `build_dist.js`.

---

## 2026-01-26 | Header Standardization & A2 Reading Worksheet

### Key Technical Achievement: Photographic Header Standardization
- **Problem**: Inconsistent branding between Bell (maroon strap) and Intensive (photographic header).
- **Solution**: Standardized on **Photographic Headers** (`bell-header.jpg` and `intensive-header.jpg`) for ALL materials.
  - Updated `developing-bespoke-materials` and `generating-worksheets` skills.
  - Refactored `validate_worksheet.py` to remove false positives for legacy logos (Bell.svg).
  - Legacy branding now generates a warning (Bell) or error (Intensive) in the validator.

### Worksheet Development: "Creative Solutions" (A2 Reading)
- **Design Strategy**: Editorial High-Density.
- **Visuals**: Switched from icons to high-quality city photography for Curitiba, Murcia, and La Paz.
- **Usability**:
  - Implemented **Vertical Listing** for matching/completion tasks to maximize handwriting space.
  - Forced **1em leading** for A2 learners.
  - Applied `#block(breakable: false)` to 100% of Task headers to prevent orphaning.
- **Result**: Compact 2-page reading worksheet with integrated assessment and answer key.

### Technical Bug Squashing
- **Typst Color**: Fixed `type color has no method with_alpha` by using `rgb(r, g, b, alpha)`.
- **Typst Strings**: Fixed `type string has no method upper` by using `upper(string)`.
- **PNG Corruption**: Resolved `failed to decode image (Format error)` by using a PIL-based repair script (`fix_images.py`).

## 2026-01-27 | Auto-Animate Matching & Build Hardening

**Objective**: Finalize and deploy the Thai-Cambodian Conflict lesson with interactive vocabulary matching and a hardened deployment pipeline.

### Architectural: "Hardened Targeted Builds"
- **Targeted Deployment**: Modified `build_dist.js` to allow `node scripts/build_dist.js [folder]`. This prevents overwriting/recopying all 10 presentations when only one is being edited.
- **GDrive Resilience**: Updated all copy logic (Python & JS) to ignore `desktop.ini` and hidden GDrive metadata that caused Windows "Permission Denied" errors.
- **Cleanup Persistence**: Wrapped `dist/` cleanup in try-catch to bypass folder locks.

### Presentation: "The Morphing Match"
- **Matching Layout**: Created a dedicated `matching.html` template. 
- **Auto-Animate**: Implemented stable `data-id` mapping so definitions physically morph and glide into position during the Answer Key reveal.
- **Visuals**: Repositioned emojis to the start of lines to function as visual bullet points on strategy slides.

### Worksheet: "Dynamic Content Filling"
- **Transcript page**: Moved the full BBC transcript to Page 4 and the Answer Key to Page 5.
- **Dynamic Lines**: Applied the Typst context-aware calculation to Page 3 to perfectly fill the remaining space with handwriting lines for Task 4.

### Skill Upgrades
- **`creating-html-presentation`**: Version 4.1. Now includes the `matching` layout catalog and mandatory GDrive file ignore rules.
- **Build Tooling**: The generator script and build script are now cross-platform safe for GDrive environments.

## 2026-01-27 (Night) | "Pro" Template Refinement & Layout Troubleshooting

### Objective
Development of the **"Pro" Worksheet Template** for the Bondi Beach Attack lesson, focusing on high-end OCR compatibility and standardized student data blocks.

### Key Technical Achievements
- **OCR-Optimized Identity Block**: 
  - Standardized the CLASS and STUDENT ID bubble containers with pure white interiors and dark gray outlines.
  - Implemented an OMR-style side-by-side grid layout for student metadata.
  - Aligned Thai instructions ("Please color the bubbles...") with centered visual examples and 13pt responsive font sizing.
- **Header Hardening**: 
  - Fixed `pro_header` width overflow issue by switching from fixed `21.05cm` to responsive `100%`, ensuring it respects page margins.
- **Orphan Prevention**: 
  - Implemented strict page breaks for Tasks 3 and 4 to prevent fragmented layouts in the 4-page booklet.

### "The Task Badge Wreck" (Ongoing Issue)
- **Problem**: The `task_badge` components (maroon/off-white split) encountered significant rendering issues, either spilling off the page or vertically stretching into "huge rectangles" when using grid-based alignment.
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent behavior of `auto` vs `1fr` widths in Typst blocks when nested inside complex grids lacking fixed width constraints.
- **Current Status**: Content logic is correct, but visual styling is currently "wrecked."

### Session Status
- **Next Steps**: Finishing tomorrow.
- **Context**: We now have the official **Typst repository** as a reference to resolve these layout/grid anomalies.

## 2026-01-29 | Presentation Deployment & Skill Formalization

**Objective**: Formalize the deployment of Reveal.js Presentations to GitHub Pages with robust asset management and automatic URL synchronization.

### Terminology Standard
- **Presentations**: The interactive Reveal.js slideshows hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Lesson Plans**: The Typst documents (`.typ`) defining the pedagogy.
- **Standard**: Strictly distinguished the two in all docs and commit history.

### Architectural: "Skill Formalization"
- **Skill Promotion**: Created the **`deploying-to-github-pages`** skill (Promoted from a legacy workflow).
- **Architecture Mapping**: Integrated **`rendering-prompts-into-mermaid`** standards to visualize the Deployment loop.
- **URL Synchronization**: Developed **`sync_lesson_plan_url.py`** to automatically inject live GitHub Pages links into Typst Lesson Plans.

### Infrastructure Hardening & CI/CD
- **Persistence**: Fixed overwriting issues by setting `keep_files: true` in the GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Incremental Builds**: Updated `build_dist.js` to support an "Incremental Mode" that accumulates presentations alongside existing ones.
- **Permissions**: Resolved 403 errors by granting `contents: write` permissions to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Action Stability**: Switched to the official **`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`** to resolve entry-point errors found in unbuilt forks.

### Asset Optimization: "Global Asset Pattern"
- **Centralization**: Moved redundant high-resolution videos (e.g., Mission Background) to a root `images/` folder.
- **CDN Referencing**: Updated presentations to reference shared assets via absolute GitHub Pages URLs, preventing 5MB+ duplication per presentation.

### Build Logic
- **Gitignore Tuning**: Patched `.gitignore` to use root-specific paths (`/dist/`) allowing presentation assets in `inputs/` to be committed.
- **Presentation Sync**: Updated `generate_presentation.py` with `dirs_exist_ok=True` to ensure new themes like `noir.css` are correctly updated in existing presentation folders.

### Policy & Standard: "Thai Translation Ban"
- **Reasoning**: Thai translations on vocabulary slides were identified as frequently inaccurate/hallucinated.
- **Standard**: Thai translations are now **STRICTLY BANNED** from all vocabulary slides across all lesson shapes.
- **Skill Implementation**: Updated `creating-html-presentation` and `writing-lesson-plans` skills to enforce this standard.
- **Validator Upgrade**: Sanitized `validate_presentation.py` to remove Thai-specific overrides from the layout safety checks.

### Output Standard: "Zero Leak/Published Pattern"
- **Encapsulation**: Updated `generate_presentation.py` to output exclusively to a **`published/`** subfolder within each lesson directory.
- **Asset Portability**: The `published/` folder now contains its own `dist/`, `plugin/`, and `images/` copies, making it a fully portable, deployable unit.
- **Build Integration**: Enhanced `build_dist.js` to prioritize the `published/` folder when compiling the dashboard, ensuring a clean separation between source materials and production output.

## 2026-01-30 | Student-Centric Presentation Overhaul & ACT Branding

### Institutional Branding: "Assumption College Mathayom"
- **Logo Integration**: Centered the official institutional logo (`images/ACT.png`) at the top of all title slides.
- **Institutional Identity**: Removed generic "B2 Intensive" badges in favor of capitalized "ASSUMPTION COLLEGE MATHAYOM" branding.
- **Header/Footer Cleanup**: Removed redundant institutional text from the footer to maximize slide real estate for pedagogical content.

### UI/UX: The "No-Box" High-Contrast Standard
- **Design Philosophy**: Abandoned all semi-transparent container boxes (`rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`) to move towards a cleaner, "floating text" cinematic look.
- **Contrast Strategy**: Achieved 100% legibility through:
  - Global `text-shadow: 3px 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,1)` for all slide text.
  - Deep background dimming (`data-background-opacity="0.4"`) for all media-heavy slides.
- **Native Tables**: Migrated all vocabulary and phrase lists (Sections A, B, C) to official Reveal.js `<table>` layouts.
- **Pagination**: Implemented manual splitting of long lists (e.g., 13 hotel phrases) across multiple slides to maintain large, readable font sizes and prevent "spills."

### Pedagogical Animation: "Morphing Logic"
- **Been vs Gone**: Refined the "The Tips" strategy slide by splitting it into distinct **Meaning** (Concept) and **Form** (Structure) slides.
- **Task 3 (Verb Forms)**: Optimized `data-auto-animate` to smoothly morph prompt phrases into their correct transformations.
- **Task 4 (Error Correction)**: 
  - **Discovery Phase**: The first slide now shows the raw text without underlines, forcing students to identify mistakes independently.
  - **Morphing reveal**: Transitions smoothly into the correction slide where mistakes (Amber) morph into fixes (Green).
  - **Linguistic Logic**: Integrated "The Why" notes directly into the answer reveal to help students internalize language patterns.

### Technical Hardening
- **Template Library**: Created `table.html` and overhauled `checklist.html`, `mission.html`, and `title.html` for reuse across the institution.
- **Script Improvement**: Updated `generate_presentation.py` to automatically copy the ACT logo from the project root to the published asset folder.
- **Animation Stability**: Standardized the use of `data-id` on `<span>` elements to ensure jump-free, pixel-perfect morphing between slides.
