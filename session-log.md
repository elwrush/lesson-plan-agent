## 2025-12-25 | Writing Lesson Plans Skill Design

### Objective
Design the `writing-lesson-plans` skill following the Skills-based architecture methodology.

### Actions Completed

1. **Ingested Skills Architecture** — Read `knowledge_base/using-skills.md` to understand the methodology
2. **Analyzed Lesson Shapes** — Reviewed `knowledge_base/lesson_shapes.yaml` (7 shapes: A-G)
3. **Identified Additional Data Fields** — Marker sentences, answer keys, transcripts, textbook/unit info
4. **Created Implementation Plan** — 8-step workflow documented in artifacts
5. **Created Skill Files**:
   - `skills/writing-lesson-plans/SKILL.md` — Main workflow (8 steps)
   - `skills/writing-lesson-plans/REFERENCE.md` — Shape summaries + example output

### Key Decisions
- Lesson plans use **markdown tables** (Stage/Aim/Procedure/Time/Interaction)
- **Answer keys** included as footer section
- **Transcripts** required for listening lessons (Shape E)

## 2025-12-27 | Templates Folder Creation

### Objective
Create reusable HTML templates to avoid skill bloat and capture design decisions.

### Templates Created

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `entry-ticket-pet-part2.html` | PET Part 2 matching (5 items, 3 matches, 2 distractors) |
| `vocabulary-box.html` | Horizontal word box with pipe separators |
| `exercise-box.html` | Blue-shaded exercise container |
| `glossary-box.html` | Red-tinted vocabulary definitions |
| `inset-image-table.html` | 2-column table for text + image layout |
| `answer-key-section.html` | Standard answer key footer |

### Files Modified
- `skills/writing-bespoke-materials/SKILL.md` — Added Templates section with links

### Design Principle
Templates accumulate reusable HTML patterns. Skills reference templates rather than embedding rules.

---

## 2025-12-27 | Google Docs HTML Push Implementation

### Objective
Push HTML materials to Google Docs with formatting preserved (colored boxes, images, tables).

### Problem Discovered
Google Docs HTML import ignores most CSS:
- No `float`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, `max-width`
- Class-based styles unreliable
- Local image paths don't resolve

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created Knowledge Base**: `knowledge_base/GDocs-HTML-Constraints.md`
2. **Created Push Script**: `scripts/push_to_gdocs.py`
   - Embeds images as base64 data URIs
   - Uses `MediaIoBaseUpload` for HTML content
   - Authenticates via dedicated `gdocs-token.json`
3. **Rewrote HTML** for Google Docs compatibility:
   - 1-cell tables for colored boxes
   - 2-column tables for image insets
   - Inline `style=""` attributes
   - `pt` units instead of `px`
   - `&nbsp;` in empty cells
   - Explicit `font-family: Roboto; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.15; margin: 0;`

### Files Created/Modified
- `knowledge_base/GDocs-HTML-Constraints.md` — Import constraint reference
- `scripts/push_to_gdocs.py` — Upload script with base64 image embedding
- `.credentials/gdocs-token.json` — OAuth token with Drive scope
- `inputs/Intensive-Reading-Politeness/intensive-reading-politeness.html` — Rewritten for Docs compatibility

### Final Output
- [27-12-25-Politeness-Reading-Intensive-v8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PptUYUrscc4-u-oh-04cdCxMqje8-FErANfsgAWgvjM/edit)

### Lessons Learned
- Google Docs is a paginated word processor, not a browser — design accordingly
- Table-based layouts are mandatory for multi-column content
- Manual adjustment may still be needed for paragraph spacing

### Refined Design Approach (Session Continuation)
After testing, user feedback led to a simpler approach:

**Avoid tables entirely** — use formatted paragraphs instead:
- Behavior ratings: Circle icons (⭘) with tabbed numbers
- Word boxes: Styled paragraphs with pipe separators
- Content boxes: Bordered paragraphs (optional shading)
- Images: Placed above text for manual wrapping

**Benefits:**
- Much easier to edit in Google Docs
- No table spacing issues
- Cleaner, more readable HTML

### Final Output (Revised)
- [27-12-25-Politeness-Reading-Intensive-FINAL-v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cp9b-L0P9NHQ3LMdTAsaTU0h_0CAIG-c2HlPcgS9GXk/edit)

## 2025-12-27 | Lesson Plan Generation & Skill Refinement

### Objective
Generate a B1 intensive reading lesson plan on politeness and refine the `writing-lesson-plans` skill.

### Actions Completed

1. **Generated Lesson Plan for Politeness Reading**
   - Collected metadata: B1, Ed Rush, 46 min, Intensive, Shape E
   - Created pre-teach vocabulary deck (5 words with phonemic script + Thai translations)
   - Incorporated special request: Thai wai video lead-in

2. **Major Skill Updates (`writing-lesson-plans/SKILL.md`)**:
   - Added Step 3: Ask Intensive vs Regular Bell lesson (header image)
   - Added Step 5: Special requests before generation
   - Changed "Aim" → "Objective" in header
   - Added "Date" field (DD-MM-YY format) after Objective
   - Changed "Page Numbers" → "Materials" with meaningful description
   - Moved pre-teach vocabulary INTO the lesson table (not header)
   - Added colored stage headers (ACT maroon) spanning table width
   - Added **Model Compliance Requirement** (critical section)
   - Defined formatting guidelines: ACT maroon colors, HTML bullets, 1.15 spacing

3. **Push Script Updates (`scripts/push_to_gdocs.py`)**:
   - Added Google Docs API scope
   - Added `set_page_format()` function to set A4 with 2cm margins via Docs API

4. **Updated `pushing-to-gdocs/SKILL.md`**:
   - Documented A4/2cm margins auto-setup
   - Updated prerequisites (Drive + Docs scopes)

### Model Compliance
Regenerated lesson plan to match Shape E model structure:
- **3 stages** (not 6): Lead-in, Reading for gist/detail, Post-reading
- Consolidated activities into logical stages matching pedagogical intent

### Files Modified
- `skills/writing-lesson-plans/SKILL.md`
- `skills/pushing-to-gdocs/SKILL.md`
- `scripts/push_to_gdocs.py`
- `inputs/Intensive-Reading-Politeness/27-12-25-LP B1-Politeness-Reading-Shape E Receptive.html`

### Final Output
- [27-12-25-LP B1-Politeness-Reading-Shape E Receptive-v3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuhsdSkX3SNCqNOeA0N1YWwaFzGncW9hwHvF3J3Sjw0/edit)

## 2025-12-27 (Evening) | Slideshow Development from Lesson Plan

### Objective
Develop a complete Google Slides presentation from the B1 Politeness Reading lesson plan.

### Actions Completed

1. **Initial Slideshow Script** — Created `create_politeness_slideshow.py` with all slide content
2. **API Efficiency Refactor** — Rewrote to batch API pattern after user feedback:
   - Changed from 100+ individual API calls to single batchUpdate call
   - Reduced execution time from 3-4 minutes to ~30 seconds
3. **Themed Slideshow** — Created `create_slideshow_themed.py` with:
   - Color-coded headers: Vocabulary (teal), Answer (green), Activity (orange), Discussion (purple), Video (red)
   - Spotlight answer layout with highlight box, snippet, and explanation
   - Video placeholder with play button (API doesn't support embedding)
4. **Cover Slide Fix** — Fixed logo paths and layout:
   - Changed `LOGO_DIR` from `skills/.../images` to `images/` at project root
   - Used Bell.png instead of Bell.svg for reliable rendering
   - Matched layout to original template (centered logos in header)

### Key Learnings
- **Batch API is essential** — Google Slides API should always use accumulated requests + single batchUpdate
- **No video embedding** — Slides API does not support YouTube embedding; must be manual
- **Logo paths matter** — Logos stored in `images/` at project root, not skill folder
- **PNG over SVG** — PNG logos render more reliably than SVG in Slides API

### Files Created/Modified
- `skills/designing-slides/create_politeness_slideshow.py` (initial version)
- `skills/designing-slides/create_slideshow_optimized.py` (batch API)
- `skills/designing-slides/create_slideshow_themed.py` (final themed version)
- `skills/designing-slides/SKILL.md` (added image rules, workflow, batch patterns)

### Final Output
- [27-12-25-Politeness-Reading-B1-THEMED](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-JNl-rJXH65aXNGVz2mV8QpguaY_hKueBs8KKn8_8-4/edit)

## 2025-12-29 | Presentation Structure Materials Development

### Objective
Create complete materials for "Presentation Skills: Structure" lesson (B1-B2, 46 minutes, Bell).

### Actions Completed

1. **Created Bespoke Worksheet** — `presentation-structure-planning-sheet.html`:
   - 4-stage structure: Hook, Exposition (Story Arc), Analysis, Recommendation
   - Color-coded sections with emojis
   - Bell header image integration
   - "Before You Present" self-check checklist
   - Pushed to Google Docs: [29-12-25-Presentation-Structure-Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwIxvcmYwkWdW-pCKgQ2hRHLFr7o0BwZv9g-G8EnzzY/edit)

2. **Updated Lesson Plan Hook** — Modified existing Shape F lesson plan:
   - Changed to "Public Speaking Fears & Fixes" hook with YouTube Short
   - Updated duration to 46 minutes
   - Pushed to Google Docs: [29-12-25-LP-Presentation-Structure-ShapeF-v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hMOXyHkT5SwHk1SHsucK0XXSBA5exJJa85vZNs9iJIQ/edit)

3. **Refined Skills**:
   - `developing-bespoke-materials`: Added duration prompt, branding rules, image fallback protocol
   - `designing-slides`: Added Expert Pedagogy principles, Title Slide Template Structure section

4. **Created Themed Slideshow** — `29-12-25-Presentation-Structure-Slides-v3`:
   - Bell EP template structure (dark header bar, logos, strap line, gradient body)
   - Expert pedagogical framing with analogies: Lion Attack, Safety Net, Temple, Rollercoaster, etc.
   - Image prompts for manual insertion (generation hit 429 rate limits)
   - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bzEceIJFHq8z2XjITcZASAFv9z1e8sWwEvgPrZ6odeA/edit

5. **Created CRITICAL-MEMORY-RULES.md** — Documentation for user to add to global memory:
   - Mandate reading `errors-fix.md` and `session-log.md` at session start
   - Skills architecture compliance requirements
   - Bell EP template structure specifications
   - Workflow approval gates

### Workflow Errors Encountered & Fixed

**Multiple critical regression:**
1. **Scope Creep**: Started writing scripts instead of simple HTML edits
2. **Missing Duration Prompt**: Didn't ask for lesson duration before generation
3. **Skipped Browser Review**: Created materials without opening for user approval
4. **Ignored Skill Requirements**: Didn't read `designing-slides` skill before creating slideshow
5. **Incorrect Template Structure**: Failed to use Bell EP template structure (header bar, logos, strap line)
6. **Skipped User Approval Table**: Didn't present slide plan before generation

All documented in `errors-fix.md` with fixes.

### 30-12-25 - Integration of McKinsey SCR Storytelling Framework

1. **Ingested McKinsey SCR Framework**:
   - Documented core principles in `knowledge_base/mckinsey.md`: Situation -> Complication -> Resolution.
   - Applied "Storytelling over Data" and "Action Titles" (Dots) vs. "Supporting Data" (Dashes) principles.
   - Integrated horizontal (titles-only) and vertical (claim-evidence) verification flows.

2. **Enhanced `lesson_shapes.yaml`**:
   - **Created Shape H (SCR Receptive Skills)**: Structured around discovery stages (Context, Complication Trigger, Deepening, Pattern Recognition, Resolution).
   - **Created Shape I (SCR Systems - Grammar/Vocabulary)**: Designed for scalability across all CEFR levels (A1-C2). Focuses on showing communication breakdown with current language, then introducing new grammar/vocab as the solution.
   - **Standardized Headers**: Updated all shapes (A-I) with a unified header block: Objective, Teacher, Date, Duration, CEFR Level, Lesson Shape, Materials, and Assessment.

3. **Restructured Politeness Reading Lesson**:
   - Mapped the "What does polite mean to you?" lesson to the SCR narrative arc.
   - Planned a substantial Resolution stage involving 3 cross-cultural scenarios for practical application.

4. **Modularized and Augmented SCR Shapes (Evening Session)**:
   - User reviewed McKinsey SCR examples (job interview Present Perfect, BTS breakdown reading) and highlighted missing elements:
     - Communication Breakdown (not just "challenge")
     - Thai L1 scaffolds (เคย/แล้ว/verb conjugation)
     - Ambiguity Tolerance for reading
     - Middle-school-appropriate scenarios (not job interviews)
     - "Hero Tool" framing for resolutions
   - Created modular Shape files:
     - `knowledge_base/shapes/shape-h.yaml`: Enhanced SCR Receptive Skills with BTS breakdown example, scanning strategy, ambiguity tolerance teaching
     - `knowledge_base/shapes/shape-i.yaml`: Enhanced SCR Systems (Grammar) with gaming guild application example, Present Perfect as "Experience Filter"
   - Both files include:
     - Detailed Thai L1 scaffolds (เคย = Present Perfect, แล้ว = completion, gone vs been trap)
     - Middle-school scenarios (BTS/LINE/gaming/Instagram/YouTube)
     - Complete example lesson plans
     - "Grammar Heroes" metaphors (Experience Filter, Upgrade Button, Politeness Shield, etc.)

## 2025-12-30 | Worksheet Generation & Publishing System (SUCCESSFUL)

### Objective
Create a programmatic system for generating and publishing Bell/Intensive worksheets to Google Drive, and migrate the legacy presentation worksheet.

### Skills Created
1. **`generating-worksheets`** - Jinja2-based PDF generation with Bell/Intensive branding
2. **`publishing-worksheets`** - Google Drive upload with automatic filename convention

### Actions Completed

1. **Skill Architecture**:
   - Created `skills/generating-worksheets/` with:
     - `templates/worksheet-master.html` (Jinja2 master template)
     - `scripts/build_worksheet.py` (Python orchestrator)
     - `scripts/pdf_converter.js` (Playwright HTML→PDF)
     - `SKILL.md` (usage documentation)
   - Created `skills/publishing-worksheets/` with:
     - `scripts/publish_to_drive.py` (Drive API upload)
     - `SKILL.md` (workflow with validation requirement)

2. **Legacy Content Migration**:
   - Converted `presentation-structure-planning-sheet.html` to modern format
   - Created `inputs/01-Presentation-Structure/presentation-content-modern.html`
   - Used Tailwind CSS grid layout (replaced legacy tables)
   - Renamed "Stage" labels to "Task" labels

3. **Asset Generation & Processing**:
   - Generated vector illustrations using Gemini 3 Pro:
     - Hook: Fishing hook catching lightbulb (metaphor for capturing attention)
     - Story Arc: Mountain plot diagram with climax peak
     - Microphone: Speech bubble with microphone (recommendation metaphor)
   - Created `smart_transparency.py` for corner-color detection
   - Processed logos and icons to remove backgrounds

4. **Critical Fixes**:
   - **Issue**: Logos had white backgrounds in PDF
   - **Root Cause**: CSS `.bell-logos img` had hardcoded `background: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 4px;`
   - **Fix**: Removed CSS background styling
   - **Issue**: Bell logo not rendering
   - **Root Cause**: SVG rendering issues in Playwright
   - **Fix**: Switched from `Bell.svg` to `Bell.png`

5. **Layout Refinements**:
   - Added page break before Task 2 (Story Arc)
   - Added page break before Task 3 "What I found difficult" section
   - Added `mt-8` margin-top for visual separation after breaks

### Key Design Decisions

- **Single Master Template**: One Jinja2 template handles both Bell and Intensive branding via `{% if brand == 'bell' %}`
- **File URI Protocol**: Used `pathlib.as_uri()` for robust path encoding (handles spaces in "LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2")
- **Content Pre-processing**: Builder script replaces `{{ image_root }}` in content fragments before master render
- **Custom Header Argument**: Added `--header-title` for Bell brand customization
- **Validation Workflow**: Publishing skill explicitly requires local PDF validation before upload

### Final Output
- Successfully generated Bell-branded PDF with:
  - Transparent logos (Bell.png + ACT_transparent.png)
  - Custom header: "Bell Language Centre" / "Structuring your Presentation"
  - Vector illustrations for each task
  - Proper page breaks for clean printing
  - A4 format with correct margins

### Lessons Learned
- Always inspect rendered HTML (`--debug` flag) before debugging path issues
- CSS can override transparency with hardcoded backgrounds
- SVG rendering in Playwright can be unreliable; prefer PNG for logos
- Path encoding matters: use `pathlib.as_uri()` for spaces in directory names
- Jinja variables in injected content fragments need manual pre-processing


### 2026-01-06 | WeasyPrint & Worksheet Refinement
- **PDF Engine Switch**: Migrated from Playwright to **WeasyPrint** in uild_worksheet.py for more reliable CSS page-break handling.
- **Header Duplication Fix**: Removed hardcoded header image from reading worksheet fragment as the master template already provides it.
- **Page Break Logic**: Reduced manual page breaks. Only a hard break before the Answer Key is now mandatory.
- **Skill Update**: Updated generating-worksheets/SKILL.md to reflect the move to WeasyPrint.
- **Output**: Generated and uploaded  5-01-26-Social-Media-Reading-Intensive-v4.pdf.
