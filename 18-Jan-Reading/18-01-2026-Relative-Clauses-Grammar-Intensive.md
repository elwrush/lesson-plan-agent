# Grammar: Relative Clauses 
**The Bountiful Harvest** (Intensive Program)

## Grammar Explanation: Relative Clauses
We use relative clauses to describe or give extra information about an object, person, or place.

| Relative Pronoun | Used for... | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **who** | People | People **who** live in urban areas now have different diets. |
| **that** / **which** | Things | The farms **that** we visited use new approaches to farming. |
| **where** | Locations / Places | More land **where** farming takes place is now being used for industry. |

### Defining vs. Non-defining Relative Clauses
*   **Defining relative clauses** give essential information to explain which specific person or thing we are talking about. 
    *   *Example*: Products **which** are environmentally friendly try to limit damage.
*   **Non-defining relative clauses** give extra information about something already defined. We use **commas** at the start and end of the clause.
    *   *Example*: The Betawi, **who** are a local group in Jakarta, are responsible for street food.
