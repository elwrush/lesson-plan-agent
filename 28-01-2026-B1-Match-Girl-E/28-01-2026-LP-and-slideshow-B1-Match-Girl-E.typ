  By the end of the lesson, learners will have practiced and developed the sub-skills of reading for detail, scanning for specific information, and identifying implicit authorial tone in the context of Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Little Match Girl', while critically evaluating themes of social responsibility and community support.

  - *Differentiated Input:* Learners self-select between B1 (Intermediate) and B2 (Upper-Intermediate) versions of the text. 
  - *Support:* B1 learners work with a simplified narrative while B2 learners engage with the complex original style.
  - *Extension:* Higher-level learners or fast-finishers are directed to the B2 'Philosophical Reflection' task to ensure they remain cognitively challenged once the core tasks are complete.

    - *Part 1 (Visual):* Display the YouTube video showing modern tent cities. T asks: "What do these people need to survive?" (Food, warmth, shelter, help). 
    - *Part 2 (Prediction):* T shows three images: *A Matchbox, A Roast Goose, A Falling Star*. In pairs, Ss guess how these items fit together in a story set 180 years ago. Feed back ideas.
    - *Part 3 (Discussion):* T asks: "Do you think the problems for a poor child in 1845 were the same or different from the problems in the video?" Elicit ideas (Cold is the same, technology is different).

  stage("TWO", "Pre-teach Vocabulary", "6", "To remove lexical barriers and ensure linguistic alignment.", [
    - *Input:* T introduces 5 key items with high-clarity context: *Barefoot* (walking on sand with no shoes), *Shivering* (moving in the cold), *Vanished* (the magic trick, item gone), *Magnificent* (a king's palace), *Soul* (the part of us that lives after the body).
    - *Clarification:* Use CCQs (Concept Check Questions). 
      - "If I am shivering, am I hot or cold?" (Cold). 
      - "If a match goes out, does the light vanish?" (Yes).
    - *Drilling:* Choral and individual drilling for pronunciation, focusing on the word stress in *mag-NIF-i-cent* and the long vowel in *barefoot*.

    - *Step A (Gist):* Ss read the B1 text quickly (Task 1 Context). In pairs, Ss choose the best title for the whole story. (Brief feedback).
    - *Step B (Detailed Reading):* Ss complete the 7 Multiple Choice questions on the worksheet. T instructs Ss to find and underline the sentence in the text that gives them the answer. (10-12 min).
    - *Step C (Peer Audit):* In pairs, Ss compare their answers. If they have different answers, they must show each other the underlined evidence in the text to "prove" who is correct. (5 min).
    - *Step D (Feedback):* T goes through the answers, eliciting the evidence from the Ss. T asks: "In the end, why was the girl smiling?" (Focus on the 'vision' of grandmother).

    - *Discussion:* T asks Ss: "Who is responsible for the little girl?" (The father? The townspeople? The government?). Discuss in small groups.
    - *Writing Task:* Ss respond briefly to the prompt on the worksheet: *"Should we help the poor? Or should they just take care of themselves?"* Ss must provide at least two reasons for their opinion.
    - *Reflection:* Ss share their most important reason with the class. T provides content feedback.
