[1] A bitter, unforgiving cold gripped the city on the final night of the year. While most residents prepared for celebrations, a thick blanket of snow covered the cobblestone streets, deepening the sense of isolation for those on the margins. In the gloom, a young girl wandered aimlessly; her tattered clothing, which offered no protection against the winter wind, was arguably the only thing she owned. Having lost her oversized slippers while dodging a carriage, she was now barefoot. One slipper had been lost in the snow, whereas the other was snatched by a mocking boy, a small act that emphasized the cruel environment she inhabited.

[2] Moving through the city was an exercise in pure endurance. Her feet were numbed into shades of raw red, yet she clutched her bundle of matches with a sense of desperate duty. It had been a disastrous day of trade; not a single soul had spared a coin, an outcome that felt inevitable given the festive distractions of the wealthy. The savory scent of roast goose, which wafted from glowing windows, served as a painful reminder of her exclusion. To her, the celebration was not a reality but a distant world, separated by a wall of glass and profound indifference.

[3] Fearing her father's inevitable anger was a greater deterrent than the lethal cold, so she dared not venture home. Besides, her dwelling offered little sanctuary, as the wind whistled through gaps in the roof. Seeking refuge, she huddled in a narrow alleyway. Her fingers were stiff with frost, and in her desperation, she decided to strike a single match. _Scritch!_ The match flared into a tiny, brilliant candle. In its magical glow, the environment seemed transformed. She was seemingly no longer in the snow but seated before a magnificent iron stove. However, just as she stretched out her feet, the match died. The stove vanished, and the cold reality returned.

[4] Striking a second match revealed a new vision. As the light expanded, the brick wall appeared to dissolve into a transparent veil. She found herself peering into a grand dining room where a feast was laid out. A succulent roast goose, stuffed with fragrant apples, steamed at the center of the table. To her astonishment, the goose leapt from its platter and waddled across the floor. Nonetheless, before it could reach her, the match extinguished, and the cold wall of the alleyway was all that remained.

[5] With the third match, she found herself beneath a spectacular Christmas tree. Thousands of candles sparkled upon its branches, an image that beckoned to her lost childhood. As she reached upward, the match went out. The lights rose until they transformed into stars. One star streaked across the heavens, leaving a fiery trail. "Someone is passing away," she thought, remembering her late grandmother—the only person who had ever treated her with genuine compassion. Her grandmother had always said that a falling star signaled a soul’s journey to the divine.

[6] Frantically, she struck another match. In the sudden radiance, her grandmother stood before her, bathed in celestial light, looking serene and incredibly kind. "Grandmother!" the girl pleaded. "Oh, please take me with you!" To prevent the vision from vanishing, which she knew would happen eventually, she struck the entire bundle of matches at once. The light became brighter than midday. Her grandmother reached out, took the girl into her arms, and together they soared through joy, far above the earth, to a place where there was no cold, no hunger, and no fear.

[7] At dawn, the townspeople discovered the small figure, her cheeks flushed and a peaceful smile gracing her lips. She had passed away during the night, surrounded by the charred remains of her matches. "She was only trying to keep herself warm," the people remarked solemnly. None of them could have imagined the magnificent splendors she had witnessed, or the radiant glory in which she had entered the New Year.
