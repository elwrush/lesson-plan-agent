## Slide 17: The Bridge Between Generations

Think of two islands with different rules. We need a bridge to understand each other.

Older Generation Island:
- Say "You're welcome"
- No phones at dinner
- Formal greetings
- Traditional respect

Younger Generation Island:
- Say "No problem" or "No worries"
- Phones are acceptable
- Casual language
- Modern flexibility

Question: Why did this bridge form? What changed between the generations?

STAGE 3: DISCUSSION (14 minutes)

## Slide 18: The Politeness Mirror

A mirror reflects what you see. Look at your own culture and generation in the mirror. What do you see?

Discussion Questions:
1. What behavior do YOU find rude?
2. Are younger people less polite than older people?

Language Toolkit (use these phrases):
- "I really dislike it when..."
- "I think / I don't think... because..."
- "In my opinion..."
- "From my experience..."

Time: 5 minutes with your partner

## Slide 19: The Telephone Game

Like passing a message in a telephone game, share what you heard.

- "They think / don't think younger people are less polite because _____."

## Slide 20: The Cultural Lens

Everyone sees the world through different glasses - like a lens or a filter.

What looks rude through your lens might look polite through mine.

The Big Idea:
Politeness is CULTURAL. What is polite in one culture may be rude in another culture.

Final Questions:
- What surprised you most today?
- How can understanding this help you in life?
- Will you do anything differently now?

Remember: Being polite means understanding that everyone has a different lens.

Thank you for your hard work today!
