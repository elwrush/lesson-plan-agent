    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15pt;">
        <img src="politeness_cross_cultural.png" width="350" style="border: 1pt solid #dddddd;">
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">1 In many countries around the world, no matter what generation you are, there are
        some key things that are considered polite behavior. Turning your phone off at dinner, turning it down on public
        transportation, not interrupting colleagues, saying please and thank you, and offering seats to those less able
        to stand than you are all considered appropriate and polite behavior in many cultures. Although most people
        agree these behaviors are polite, there is a big difference in politeness between the generations. It was once
        considered polite to stand when someone left the dinner table, but this is no longer the case. Additionally,
        older generations are the most likely to judge someone's politeness, but what other factors influence politeness
        in society?</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">2 While languages change over time in terms of words being added or taken away, they
        also change in terms of their structure and use. Some phrases are not really used for their actual meaning but
        as polite social phrases. For example, when someone says "thank you," how should we reply? Older people are more
        likely to say "You're welcome," whereas younger people are more likely to say "No problem." The concepts of
        polite behavior don't just vary by age, they also vary by geographic location. How we display polite behavior in
        one place is quite different in another.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">3 From tipping, to smiling, and how you eat, there are different ways to show
        politeness across the world. Take tipping for instance, which is polite and expected in countries such as the
        U.S.A. However, in Japan tipping is not expected in any situation and may even create a difficult situation by
        offending someone. The hand you use to do different things is not important in most European cultures, but in
        India the left hand is considered unclean and shouldn't be used to eat, greet, or exchange money. Some people
        now even argue that asking for directions is rude. People have phones for that and should not need to interrupt
        other people.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">4 This is not the only influence technology is having on what is considered polite
        behavior. Cell phones have changed what is considered polite behavior in many situations. To some people even
        just having your phone at the dinner table is thought to be impolite. An even greater number are likely to
        consider speaking on the phone during dinner as rude. However, some people argue that there are differences in
        this depending on people's age. Take sending e-mails in a meeting from your phone. Many younger people are
        likely to consider this as acceptable whereas older people are much more likely to have a negative reaction and
        find this rude. Overall those under 30 are arguably much more tolerant of people using cell devices at a meal,
        during a meeting, or in a class. Younger generations simply have a different perspective on what is socially
        acceptable behavior when it comes to using technology. Digital devices are not only changing how we behave but
        also what we consider polite behavior.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">5 The concept of politeness varies greatly across cultures and generations. What is
        acceptable in one context may cause great offence in another. Adapting our behavior to suit other people and the
        situation is a skill we all need to learn.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #b58900; font-size: 14pt;">C Global reading</h2>

    <p>Topic sentences are usually one of the first two sentences of each paragraph. They contain the main idea of the
        paragraph and everything in that paragraph should support the main idea. Reading topic sentences is a good way
        to scan a text quickly.</p>

    <p>1. Read <em>What does polite mean to you?</em> and underline the topic sentences in paragraphs 2-4.</p>

    <p>2. Match the main ideas below with paragraphs 2-4.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A People use different phrases for politeness. _______</li>
        <li>B Technology has changed what is thought of as polite. _______</li>
        <li>C Politeness varies across cultures. _______</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section D: Close Reading -->
    <h2 style="color: #b58900; font-size: 14pt;">D Close reading</h2>

    <p>Read <em>What does polite mean to you?</em> again and complete the paragraph.</p>

    <p>The attitudes to polite behavior change depending on age, but also on geography. For example, in response to
        "thank you," older people are likely to say <sup>1</sup>_____________ and younger generations would say
        <sup>2</sup>_____________. In other countries, customs change too: <sup>3</sup>_____________ is not common in
        Japan, and in India you shouldn't use your <sup>4</sup>_____________ for eating or greeting. Recently,
        technology has also changed our polite behavior norms. A few people think <sup>5</sup>_____________ with you
        while you eat is rude, and <sup>6</sup>_____________ often do not think it's OK to send e-mails during a
        meeting.</p>
