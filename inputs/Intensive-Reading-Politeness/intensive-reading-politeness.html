    <h1>Reading: What does polite mean to you?</h1>

    <div class="reading-passage">
        <img src="../images/politeness_cross_cultural.png" alt="Japanese bow, Thai high wai, and Western handshake"
            style="width: 45%; float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 20px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        <p>1 In many countries around the world, no matter what generation you are, there are some key things that are
            considered polite behavior. Turning your phone off at dinner, turning it down on public transportation, not
            interrupting colleagues, saying please and thank you, and offering seats to those less able to stand than
            you are all considered appropriate and polite behavior in many cultures. Although most people agree these
            behaviors are polite, there is a big difference in politeness between the generations. It was once
            considered polite to stand when someone left the dinner table, but this is no longer the case. Additionally,
            older generations are the most likely to judge someone's politeness, but what other factors influence
            politeness in society?</p>

        <p>2 While languages change over time in terms of words being added or taken away, they also change in terms of
            their structure and use. Some phrases are not really used for their actual meaning but as polite social
            phrases. For example, when someone says "thank you," how should we reply? Older people are more likely to
            say "You're welcome," whereas younger people are more likely to say "No problem." The concepts of polite
            behavior don't just vary by age, they also vary by geographic location. How we display polite behavior in
            one place is quite different in another.</p>

        <p>3 From tipping, to smiling, and how you eat, there are different ways to show politeness across the world.
            Take tipping for instance, which is polite and expected in countries such as the U.S.A. However, in Japan
            tipping is not expected in any situation and may even create a difficult situation by offending someone. The
            hand you use to do different things is not important in most European cultures, but in India the left hand
            is considered unclean and shouldn't be used to eat, greet, or exchange money. Some people now even argue
            that asking for directions is rude. People have phones for that and should not need to interrupt other
            people.</p>

        <p>4 This is not the only influence technology is having on what is considered polite behavior. Cell phones have
            changed what is considered polite behavior in many situations. To some people even just having your phone at
            the dinner table is thought to be impolite. An even greater number are likely to consider speaking on the
            phone during dinner as rude. However, some people argue that there are differences in this depending on
            people's age. Take sending e-mails in a meeting from your phone. Many younger people are likely to consider
            this as acceptable whereas older people are much more likely to have a negative reaction and find this rude.
            Overall those under 30 are arguably much more tolerant of people using cell devices at a meal, during a
            meeting, or in a class. Younger generations simply have a different perspective on what is socially
            acceptable behavior when it comes to using technology. Digital devices are not only changing how we behave
            but also what we consider polite behavior.</p>

        <p>5 The concept of politeness varies greatly across cultures and generations. What is acceptable in one context
            may cause great offence in another. Adapting our behavior to suit other people and the situation is a skill
            we all need to learn.</p>

        <p>Topic sentences are usually one of the first two sentences of each paragraph. They contain the main idea of
            the paragraph and everything in that paragraph should support the main idea. Reading topic sentences is a
            good way to scan a text quickly.</p>
        <p>1. Read <em>What does polite mean to you?</em> and underline the topic sentences in paragraphs 2-4.</p>
        <p>2. Match the main ideas below with paragraphs 2-4.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A People use different phrases for politeness. <span class="gap" style="min-width: 20px;"></span></li>

        <p>Read <em>What does polite mean to you?</em> again and complete the paragraph.</p>
        <p>The attitudes to polite behavior change depending on age, but also on geography. For example, in response to
            "thank you," older people are likely to say <sup>1</sup><span class="gap"></span> and younger generations
            would say <sup>2</sup><span class="gap"></span>. In other countries, customs change too: <sup>3</sup><span
                class="gap"></span> is not common in Japan, and in India you shouldn't use your <sup>4</sup><span
                class="gap"></span> for eating or greeting. Recently, technology has also changed our polite behavior
            norms. A few people think <sup>5</sup><span class="gap"></span> with you while you eat is rude, and
            <sup>6</sup><span class="gap"></span> often do not think it's OK to send e-mails during a meeting.
