– Warning: "Fake praise = Boring. Honest analysis = Unforgettable."

---

### Slide 13: Analysis Example — Harry Potter Under the Microscope
• **Balanced verdict = Loves + Hates + Eternal Lesson**

– Three sections:

  **LOVE CHAMBER:**  
  "The friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt so REAL. When Ron's wand backfired and he vomited slugs to protect Hermione, I knew these friends would die for each other. That loyalty made me cry."
  
  **HATE CHAMBER:**  
  "The Dursleys were TOO cruel. Reading about Harry sleeping in a cupboard and getting zero birthday presents for 11 years made me physically angry. It felt excessive."
  
  **WISDOM CHAMBER:**  
  "This book taught me that chosen family (friends) can be stronger than blood family. Hermione and Ron saved Harry more than his relatives ever did."

  **Mission C:**  
  "I recommend this book to people who've lost someone they love because it shows how the dead never truly leave us."

– Prohibition: "NEVER say 'I recommend this to everyone.' Specific = Powerful."

---
