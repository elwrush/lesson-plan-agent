**Target Time:** 45 minutes

## Stage 1: Lead-in (5 min)
**Aim:** To engage Ss and activate schemata
**Procedure:**
- **Future Food Fact or Fiction**: Display 3 statements about future foods (e.g., "In the future, we will eat burgers made of bugs").
- Ss discuss in pairs and vote 'Fact' or 'Fiction'.
- Elicit brief discussion on unusual foods they have tried or heard of. (T-Ss / Ss-Ss)

## Stage 2: Pre-teach Vocab (8 min)
**Aim:** To remove barriers to the text
**Procedure:**
- **Contextual Discovery**: Present 5 target words from the reading strategy: *algae, unexceptional, crickets, molecules, extract*.
- T provides English context sentences on slides.
- Ss match words to definitions/types of speech in pairs (S-S).
- Model and drill pronunciation, highlighting word stress in *un-ex-cep-tion-al* and *mol-e-cules*. (T-S)

## Stage 3: Gist / Scanning (7 min)
**Aim:** To practice scanning for specific topics
**Procedure:**
- **Speed Scan**: Set a 2-minute timer.
- Ss scan the social media conversation to answer: "Which three future foods are discussed?" (algae, crickets, The Impossible Burger).
- **Feedback**: Elicit answers and ask specific scanning strategy questions: "Which words helped you quickly spot the foods?" (T-S)

## Stage 4: Main Task (Detail) (15 min)
**Aim:** To practice reading for specific detail and verifying information
**Procedure:**
- **Data Detective**: Ss read the full conversation.
- Ss complete Exercise 2 (True/False, correcting false sentences) and Exercise 3 (Yes/No with evidence sentences) individually.
- **Peer-Check**: Ss compare answers in pairs and justify their choices. (S-S)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Discuss answers as a class, eliciting the specific sentences from the text that provide the evidence. (T-S)

## Stage 5: Vocabulary Focus (5 min)
**Aim:** To figure out meaning from context
**Procedure:**
- **Context Clues**: Point to the "Reading strategy" box.
- Ss complete Exercise 1, focusing on parts of speech, synonyms, antonyms, and prefixes.
- T clarifies how prefixes like *un-* change meanings and how context clues reveal definitions. (T-Ss)

## Stage 6: Post-task (5 min)
**Aim:** To personalize the topic
**Procedure:**
- **Talking Points**: Ss discuss Exercise 4 questions in small groups: "Which of the foods would you most/least like to eat? Why?"
- T circulates to capture interesting ideas.
- Brief class feedback to conclude. (T-Ss)
