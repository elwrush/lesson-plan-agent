  By the end of the lesson, learners will have practiced the sub-skills of scanning for information and reading for specific detail in the context of a social media conversation about future foods.

  Support is provided through pre-teaching high-frequency technical vocabulary (e.g., algae, molecules) and using a "Speed Scan" phase to build confidence before the detailed data extraction task. Fast finishers are encouraged to search for and describe other future foods not mentioned in the text.
