# SOURCE TEXT - How do we choose our food?

## Reading Strategy
**Figuring out meaning from context**
When you read a text, you may come across key words which you don't know. Ask yourself:
* What type of word is it: noun, verb, etc.? Does it have a prefix or suffix that can help you?
* Is there a synonym or an antonym of the word in the sentence or the surrounding sentences? Is it paraphrased, or followed by an example?

## Vocabulary Exercise (1)
1. **algae**
   a) What type of word is it?
   b) What synonym for algae is used in the next sentence?
2. **unexceptional**
   a) What part of speech is it?
   b) What does the prefix tell you?
   c) How is unexceptional paraphrased in the next sentence?
3. **crickets**
   a) What part of speech is it?
   b) What word in the previous sentence tells you what a cricket is?
4. **molecules**
   a) What part of speech is it?
   b) How is it paraphrased?
5. **extract**
   a) What part of speech is it?
   b) What opposite is used in the same sentence?

## True/False Exercise (2)
Read the conversation again and decide if the sentences are true (T) or false (F). Correct the false sentences.
1. The food in the photo is a typical Japanese dish.
2. Using orange juice makes the bars unexceptional.
3. Cricket flour contains a lot of protein.
4. Eating insects is good for the environment.
5. The Impossible Burger doesn't contain meat.
6. "Heme" for artificial beef is extracted from real beef.

## Yes/No Exercise (3)
Answer the questions yes or no. Find the sentence(s) in the conversation that give you this information.
1. Has foodyperson made snack bars with algae in the past?
2. Is growing algae better for the environment than traditional farming?
3. Can you use insects for baking at home?
4. Is it difficult to raise crickets for food?
5. Is the heme molecule only found in meat?
6. Is there any evidence that The Impossible Burger tastes like "real" beef?

## Discussion Exercise (4)
Answer the questions. Use ideas from the social media conversation.
1. Which of the three foods mentioned would you most like to eat? Why?
2. Which would you least like to eat? Why?
3. Search online to find other "future foods." Describe one, and say whether or not you would like to try it.

## Reading Text: The food of the future - today
**foodyperson:** I've found the food of the future, and it's here today! Has anyone else tried making snack bars with **algae**? I know Japanese food (which I love, by the way) uses sea plants – algae and others. But this is the first time I've used it in a snack bar recipe!

**emmy2003:** Haven't tried it. What's the flavor like? It's hard to tell from the picture.

**foodyperson:** They're made with lots of nuts and seeds in addition to the algae, and the sweetener is orange juice! So they're nutty, and a bit sweet. To be honest, the flavor is **unexceptional** for a snack bar – you know, nothing special. #superhealthy

**ahmed101:** Why is algae the food of the future?

**foodyperson:** Traditional farming has a big carbon footprint. Algae doesn't. Also it's very easy to grow, and doesn't use a lot of fresh water. Algae even grows in the ocean and it's a great source of protein.

**emmy2003:** Apparently insects are also a great source of protein. And you can buy protein bars made with insects.

**foodyperson:** I've heard they're "perfect protein." Have you tried one? What are they like?

**emmy2003:** They taste and look just like normal energy bars. And don't worry, you can't see the insects! The **crickets** are made into flour. You can buy the flour online, so you can try baking with it, too, if you want to.

**foodyperson:** I'll think about it!

**emmy2003:** One reason they're a "food of the future" is that you could easily raise crickets in a city. It's basically meat protein. But they don't need a lot of land like traditional farms.

**foodyperson:** I've heard of another meat that isn't made from animals. There's a company called The Impossible Burger that creates meat from plant sources.

**emmy2003:** Creates meat? I don't get it.

**foodyperson:** Well, everything in the world is made up of **molecules** – tiny pieces of chemicals – right? So, they've figured out which molecules make up meat, and they get those same molecules from non-meat sources and mix them together. Apparently the secret ingredient is a molecule called "heme." That's what gives red meat its color and flavor. But it's found in all living things, including plants. They **extract** heme from plants, and put it into their food product with other proteins and ingredients that make it look, feel, and taste like beef.

**ahmed101:** That's amazing! Have you tried it?

**foodyperson:** Not yet. But I've seen online videos of people who have tried it, and they say it tastes just like real beef!
