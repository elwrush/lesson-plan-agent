[1] The year was ending, and a freezing wind blew through the dark streets. It was New Year's Eve. Snow fell on a poor little girl who walked alone in the cold. She carried matches in her hand to sell, but her day had been very difficult. She was barefoot because she had lost her slippers while crossing the street. One slipper had disappeared in the snow, and a rude boy had run away with the other.

[2] Her tiny feet were red and blue from the cold. She clutched her matchbox, but no one had bought anything from her all day. She was shivering and hungry, and she could smell the delicious roast goose cooking in the nearby houses. The lights from the windows danced in the snow, making her feel even more alone.

[3] She was afraid to go home because her father would be angry that she had made no money. Besides, her house was almost as cold as the street. She sat down in a corner between two houses. Her hands felt completely frozen. She thought, "Perhaps just one match could warm me." She struck it against the wall. _Scritch!_ A bright flame appeared. It felt as if she were sitting in front of a large, beautiful iron stove. The fire was warm and wonderful, but just as she reached out her feet, the match went out. The stove vanished.

[4] She struck a second match. The light made the wall look like a thin curtain. Through it, she saw a grand room with a table covered in a white cloth. A roast goose was waiting on the table. To her surprise, the goose jumped down and started towards her! But the match went out, and the vision was replaced by the cold, dark wall. 

[5] With the third match, she found herself under a magnificent Christmas tree. Thousands of candles sparkled on the branches. As she reached for them, the match went out and the lights rose higher, turning into stars. One star fell, leaving a trail of fire. "Someone is dying," she whispered. Her old grandmother had told her that a falling star meant a soul was going to heaven.

[6] She struck another match, and there stood her grandmother, looking kind and bright. "Grandmother!" she cried. "Take me with you!" She quickly lit the rest of her matches to keep the vision alive. They burned brighter than the day. Her grandmother took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew high into the sky, far away from the cold and the hunger. 

[7] The next morning, the townspeople found the little girl. She was sitting in the corner with a peaceful smile, but she had frozen to death. "She was trying to keep warm," they said. No one knew the beautiful things she had seen, or the joy she felt as she entered the New Year with her grandmother.
