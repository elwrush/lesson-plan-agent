# Slideshow Outline: Preparing Your Talk

## Slide 1: What Scares You?
- What makes you nervous about speaking?

- Today: 3 Hero Tools to fix Sound, Sight, and Mind

## Slide 3: Transition
- Hero Tool #1: The Sound of English

## Slide 4: Linking Sounds (Connection)
- Thai: Words are separate (First. Of. All.)
- English: Words connect like a chain (FIR-stuh-VALL)
- Don't stop breathing between words!

## Slide 5: Practice: Linking
- 1. First of all
- 2. I'd like to
- 3. Look at this
- 4. Let me explain
- *Say it smoothly, not choppily!*

## Slide 6: Answer: The Flow
- 1. First of all → **FIR-stuh-VALL**
- 2. I'd like to → **I'd-LIKE-tuh**
- 3. Look at this → **LOO-kuh-THIS**
- 4. Let me explain → **LET-mee-ex-PLAIN**
- *Did you connect the sounds?*

## Slide 7: Syllable Stress (Rhythm)
- Thai: Even stress on every syllable
- English: ONE loud syllable. The rest are quiet.
- Trap: Don't stress the END (imporTANT ❌)
- Fix: Stress the MIDDLE (im-POR-tant ✅)

## Slide 8: Practice: Fix the Stress
- im-POR-tant
- IN-ter-est-ing
- COMF-ter-ble
- pre-SENT (verb) vs PRE-sent (noun)

## Slide 9: Answer: The Rhythm
- **im-POR-tant** (not imporTANT)
- **IN-ter-est-ing** (3 syllables, first is loud)
- **COMF-ter-ble** (sounds like 3 syllables)
- **pre-SENT** (Action) vs **PRE-sent** (Gift/Now)
