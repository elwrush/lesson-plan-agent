    <!-- COMPLICATION: The Challenge -->
    <h2>2. COMPLICATION: Too Many Opinions!</h2>

    <p>Read the text below about the impact of social media. There are <b>8 different perspectives</b>.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">(Source: "Social Media Society")</p>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p><span class="section-num">1. Social media is changing everything</span><br>
            Social media is changing how we communicate, how we do business, and how we live in society. People use it
            to stay in touch with others, to get people’s attention and to check the news. When we consider this is only
            20 or 30 years after the start of the Web it is not surprising that it is considered one of the biggest ever
            changes in modern society. So, has social media been a positive or negative development for society?</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">2. People are less connected</span><br>
            Many people argue that social media makes young people antisocial. In 1998 psychiatrist Tamaki Saito
            invented the term “hikikomori” which translates into English as avoiding social contact. It describes a
            growing number of young men who shut themselves away in their bedrooms from society and use technology more
            and more. Research suggests this is not only a Japanese problem but one that exists around the world.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">3. The only way to socialize</span><br>
            However, other people believe that social media is not more popular because young people are more
            antisocial. In comparison to the past, many children are not allowed out as much to play. As a result, many
            use social media to stay in touch with friends because they are not allowed to see them as often. It also
            allows them to feel part of a wider group.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">4. Not just for young people</span><br>
            Some think the Internet is just for young people, but this trend is slowly changing. One of the fastest
            growing groups of social media users is now grandparents who are using it to keep in touch with other
            people. Since people now move around a lot for work, many grandparents use it to keep in touch with their
            own children or grandchildren.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">5. Online profile</span><br>
            Though social media helps us to communicate with other people, it can also change how we see ourselves. Some
            argue that social media makes us compare ourselves more to other people because we often just post the
            highlights of our lives. This makes us feel anxious about what other people think of us and can make people
            depressed.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">6. Being popular</span><br>
            Equally, social media is now often considered a popularity contest. From how many people follow us to how
            many “likes” we get, it can have a big effect on how we feel about ourselves. People often feel anxious
            about how many “likes” they get on a picture or comment. Many people feel hurt if people don’t like their
            pictures or posts.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">7. Wanting everything now</span><br>
            Social media also makes us want everything now. The idea of wanting something immediately is connected to
            another basic human need for food, water, and shelter. We reply almost immediately to e-mails and posts.
            Unfortunately, we are now becoming much worse at waiting for things and social media is in part making this
            issue worse.</p>

        <p><span class="section-num">8. Time to stop?</span><br>
            On the one hand, social media makes our world more connected than ever. On the other hand, it also makes
            many people feel more anxious about their own image, creates false friendship groups, and many people are
            less patient. Perhaps we all need to take a break.</p>
