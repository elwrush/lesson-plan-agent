      - Display the worksheet title: "The Bountiful Harvest - Relative Clauses."
      - Ask Ss: "What's your favourite food? Where does it come from?" Elicit 2-3 responses.
      - Show a simple sentence on the board: "I like pizza." Then add: "Pizza is Italian." Ask: "Can we combine these?"
      - Elicit or guide Ss to: "I like pizza, which is Italian."
      - Explain: "Today we'll learn how to combine sentences like this using relative clauses."

      - *Meaning*: Use the marker sentences on the board:
        - "Farmers *who* sell in local markets often earn more." (Defining - essential info)
        - "Pomegranates, *which* are delicious, are rich in vitamins." (Non-defining - extra info)
      - Ask CCQs: "In sentence 1, do we know which farmers? (Yes, the ones who sell locally). In sentence 2, can we remove 'which are delicious'? (Yes, it's extra)."
      - *Form*: Draw a table on the board showing:
        - *who* → People
        - *which/that* → Things
        - *where* → Places
      - Highlight the comma rule: Non-defining clauses need commas; defining clauses don't.
      - *Pronunciation*: Drill the marker sentences chorally and individually. Focus on:
        - /huː/ for "who"
        - /wɪtʃ/ for "which"
        - /weə(r)/ for "where"
        - Stress the intonation drop before commas in non-defining clauses.
      - Write phonemic script on the board for Thai learners: /huː/, /wɪtʃ/, /weə(r)/.

      - Peer check: Ss compare answers in pairs.
      - Feedback: Project or write answers on the board. Address any errors (e.g., comma placement).
      - *Task 2 (Fill the Gaps)*: Ss complete sentences with *who*, *which/that*, or *where*. Set a 4-minute timer.
      - Monitor for correct pronoun selection.
      - Feedback: Elicit answers from Ss. Drill pronunciation of completed sentences.

      - Ss work in pairs to complete the remaining 3 sentences. Set a 5-minute timer.
      - Monitor and assist with clause placement and comma usage.
      - Feedback: Invite pairs to write their answers on the board. Discuss alternatives (e.g., "The people, who live on small islands, mostly eat fish" vs. defining version).
