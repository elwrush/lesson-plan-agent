[1] It was bitterly cold. It snowed, and it was getting dark on the last night of the year, New Year's Eve. In this cold and darkness, a poor little girl walked through the streets. She was barefoot and carried matches in her hand. She had lost her large slippers while crossing the street. One slipper was lost, and a boy ran off with the other.

[2] The little girl walked on with tiny naked feet, red and blue with cold. No one had bought any matches from her all day, and she had no money. She was shivering and hungry. Lights were shining from every window, and there was a savory smell of roast goose in the street.

[3] She sat down and huddled in a corner between two houses. She was afraid to go home because her father would beat her for not selling any matches. Besides, it was cold at home, too. Her hands were almost frozen. She thought, "A match might do some good." She struck one. *Scritch!* It was a warm, bright flame. It seemed to her as if she were sitting in front of a warm iron stove. She stretched out her feet to warm them, but the flame went out, and the stove vanished.

[4] She rubbed another match against the wall. Where the light fell, the wall became transparent like a curtain. She saw a table with a white cloth and fine china. A roasted goose, stuffed with apples, smoked on the table. Then the match went out, and there remained only the cold wall.

[5] She lighted another match. Now she was sitting under a magnificent Christmas tree. Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches. When the match went out, the lights rose higher until they became stars. One fell, leaving a long trail of fire. "Someone is dying," she thought. Her grandmother had told her that when a star falls, a soul goes to God.

[6] She drew another match. In the light stood her old grandmother, bright and loving. "Grandmother!" she cried. "Take me with you!" She quickly lit all the matches to keep her grandmother there. The matches burned brighter than daylight. Her grandmother took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor fear.

[7] In the morning, the townspeople found the girl frozen in the corner with a smile on her face. "She wanted to warm herself," they said. No one knew what beautiful things she had seen before she went with her grandmother to the New Year's joy.

[1] A freezing wind swept through the darkened streets on the final night of the year. It was New Year's Eve, yet for one small girl, there was no celebration. She wandered through the cold and gloom, barefoot and shivering, carrying matches in her tattered apron. Earlier, she had been wearing slippers that belonged to her mother, but she lost them while dodging two carriages racing through the town. One slipper vanished in the snow, and the other was snatched by a mischievous boy.

[2] The little girl trudged on, her feet numbed into shades of red and blue. She clutched her matchbox, but it had been a disastrous day; not a single passerby had spared a coin. Fearing her father’s wrath should she return empty-handed, she dared not venture home. Furthermore, her dwelling offered little protection, as cold winds whistled through the gaps in the roof.

[3] Seeking refuge, she huddled in a corner between two houses. Her fingers were stiff like icicles. Driven by desperation, she decided to strike a single match just for a little warmth. *Scritch!* The match flared into life, burning with a bright flame like a tiny candle. In its magical glow, she felt as though she were seated before a magnificent iron stove. The fire inside roared with a comforting heat. She reached out her feet, but in that instant, the flame flickered and died. The stove vanished.

[4] Determined, she struck another. As the light expanded, the brick wall seemed to dissolve into a veil. She found herself peering into a grand dining room where a table was laden with a white cloth and fine china. A succulent roast goose, stuffed with fragrant apples, steamed at the center. To her amazement, the goose leapt from its platter and waddled across the floor with a knife and fork in its breast. However, before it could reach her, the match extinguished, leaving her once again in the darkness.

[5] With the third match, she was transported beneath a spectacular Christmas tree. Thousands of candles sparkled upon its green branches, and colorful ornaments beckoned to her. As she reached upward, the match went out. The lights ascended until they became the brilliant stars of the winter sky. One star streaked across the heavens, leaving a trail of fiery light. "Someone is passing away," she thought, remembering her late grandmother—the only soul who had ever treated her with genuine compassion. Her grandmother had always said that a falling star signaled a soul’s journey to the divine.

[6] Frantically, she struck another match. In the sudden radiance, her grandmother stood before her, bathed in celestial light, looking serene and kind. "Grandmother!" the girl pleaded. "Oh, please take me with you! I know you will vanish just like the stove and the great Christmas tree." To keep her grandmother near, she struck the entire bundle of matches at once. The light became brighter than midday. Her grandmother reached out, took the girl into her arms, and together they soared through joy, far above the earth, to a place where there was no cold, no hunger, and no fear.

[7] In the dawn, the townspeople discovered the small figure in the corner, a peaceful smile on her lips. She had frozen to death on that final night. Surrounding her were the remains of many burnt matches. "She was trying to keep herself warm," the people remarked solemnly. None of them could have imagined the magnificent splendors she had witnessed, or the radiant glory in which she had entered the New Year with her grandmother.
