[1] It was bitterly cold. It snowed, and it was getting dark on the last night of the year, New Year's Eve. In this cold and darkness, which was dangerous for a child, a poor little girl walked through the streets. She was barefoot and carried matches in her hand. She had lost her large slippers, which were her mother's, while crossing the street. One slipper was lost, and a boy ran off with the other.

[2] The little girl walked on with tiny naked feet, red and blue with cold. No one had bought any matches from her all day, and she had no money. She was shivering and hungry. Lights were shining from every window, and there was a savory smell of roast goose in the street. She carried on walking, but she felt very weak and alone.

[3] She sat down and huddled in a corner between two houses. She was afraid to go home because her father would beat her for not selling any matches. Besides, it was cold at home, where the wind whistled through the roof. Her hands were almost frozen. She thought, "A match might do some good." She struck one. *Scritch!* It was a warm, bright flame. It seemed to her as if she were sitting in front of a warm iron stove, which was roaring with fire. She stretched out her feet to warm them, but the flame went out, and the stove vanished.

[4] She rubbed another match against the wall. Where the light fell, the wall became transparent like a curtain. She saw a table with a white cloth and fine china. A roasted goose, stuffed with apples, smoked on the table. Then the match went out, and there remained only the cold wall. She lighted another match. Now she was sitting under a magnificent Christmas tree. Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches. When the match went out, the lights rose higher until they became stars. One fell, leaving a long trail of fire. "Someone is dying," she thought. Her grandmother had told her that when a star falls, a soul goes to God.

[5] She drew another match. In the light stood her old grandmother, bright and loving. "Grandmother!" she cried. "Take me with you!" She quickly lit all the matches to keep her grandmother there. The matches burned brighter than daylight. Her grandmother took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor fear.

[6] In the morning, the townspeople found the girl frozen in the corner with a smile on her face. "She wanted to warm herself," they said. No one knew what beautiful things she had seen before she went with her grandmother to the New Year's joy.
