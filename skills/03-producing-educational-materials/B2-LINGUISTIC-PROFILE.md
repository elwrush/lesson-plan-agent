# B2 Linguistic Profile: Educational Text Standards

This document defines the linguistic and rhetorical standards for B2 (Upper Intermediate) educational texts, based on the analysis of high-quality pedagogical materials focusing on social and cultural analysis.

## 1. Rhetoric & Tone
*   **Analytical Signposting**: Uses rhetorical questions in headers (*"What does polite mean to you?"*) to engage the reader's prior knowledge.
*   **Nuanced Tone**: Moves beyond simple facts to explore perspectives, debates, and qualifying statements (hedging).
*   **Abstract Concepts**: Capable of discussing sociological or cultural themes (*politeness*, *socially acceptable behavior*, *generational differences*).

## 2. Coherence & Cohesion
*   **Logical Connectors**: Uses a wide range of sophisticated markers to show contrast and addition: *whereas, additionally, however, for instance, no matter what, overall*.
*   **Complex Substitution**: Uses "this" or "that" to refer back to entire concepts or clauses (*"this is no longer the case"*, *"this is not the only influence"*).
*   **Thematic Paragraphing**: Each paragraph introduces a specific sub-topic (e.g., Technology's influence) and develops it fully with evidence or examples.

## 3. Lexis (Vocabulary)
*   **Academic / Semi-Formal**: Uses precise vocabulary for social analysis: *appropriate, perspective, context, offense, tolerate, influence, considered*.
*   **Hedging & Probability**: Uses qualifiers to avoid overgeneralization: *arguably, thought to be, likely to, arguably much more tolerant*.
*   **Strong Collocations**: *socially acceptable behavior, negative reaction, geographic location, cultural norms*.
*   **Nominalization**: Uses gerunds or nouns as subjects to create more formal, dense sentences (*"Turning your phone off..."*, *"Adapting our behavior..."*).

## 4. Grammatical Structures
*   **Passive Voice (Complex)**: Frequent use of the passive to describe social norms and widespread beliefs: *are considered, is thought to be, is expected, is no longer the case*.
*   **Complex Subordination**: Combines multiple ideas into single sentences using *while, whereas, given that, in terms of*.
*   **Relative Clauses**: Uses both defining and non-defining relative clauses to add density and precision (*"those less able to stand than you"*, *"tipping... which is polite and expected"*).
*   **Infinitives & Gerunds**: Sophisticated use of infinitive/gerund patterns (*"...likely to have..."*, *"is thought to be..."*).
