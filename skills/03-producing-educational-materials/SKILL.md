# Producing Educational Materials

## Purpose
Guide the transition from raw educational requirements to print-ready, professionally branded PDF worksheets. Consolidates pedagogical design with high-density Typst production. 

### 🛑 MANDATORY: ZERO HALLUCINATION POLICY
**You MUST NOT guess Typst syntax.** Before you write or edit any `.typ` file (Phase 4), if you are unsure of a layout, table, or list implementation, you **MUST** use the `consult_repo` tool (from skill 16) to check the official Typst repository (`typst:crates/typst-library/src/`).

## STRICT RULE: NEVER abbreviate, change, or truncate source text. Professional materials must maintain 100% instructional integrity.**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering & Consultation
You MUST consult with the user on these core constraints:
- **CEFR Level**: A1-C2 (mandatory).
- **Skill/System**: Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking, Grammar, Vocabulary, or Pronunciation.
- **Duration**: Target lesson length.
- **Program Selection**: **CRITICAL**. Prompt user to choose between **Bell** and **Intensive**. 
  - *Assets Location*: Branded straps found in `C:\Users\elwru\AppData\Roaming\typst\packages\local\bell-sheets\0.1.0\images\`.
- **Hero Image Requirement**: **MANDATORY**. Every worksheet MUST have a hero image.
  - Ask the user for keywords to search Pixabay.
  - If Pixabay search fails or is unsuitable, prompt the user to provide a manual image path.
- **Badge Choice**: **MANDATORY**. Always include exactly three badges: CEFR Level, Skill, and Topic.
  - *Format*: Maroon rectangles with white bold text.
  - *Constraint*: Never include lesson duration in a badge.
- **Mission Mandate (The 'Cambridge Hook')**:
    -   **Headline**: MUST be "YOUR MISSION" in maroon bold.
    -   **Intro Text**: MUST explain the relevance to a specific Cambridge exam (e.g., "In your PET for Schools exam, you often have to...").
    -   **Structure**: A light pink block with a maroon border.
    -   **Icons**: 3 distinct boxes/columns for objectives, each with a relevant icon.
- **Writing/Critical Thinking Choice**: **MANDATORY**. Prompt user: *"Would you like to include an extension writing or critical thinking task? (Yes/No)"*.
  - **Action**: If "Yes", you MUST design a task aligned with the CEFR profile. If "No", do NOT invent any personal response or analysis tasks.
  - **Action**: If "Yes", you MUST execute Step 2 (Deterministic Gate).

### Step 2: Deterministic Data Gate (If Quiz is 'Yes')
To prevent LLM "probabilistic laziness" in option placement:
1. **Script First**: Write and run a Python script to generate randomized answer keys (e.g., `[1, 0, 1, 1...]`) and select anchor quotes from the text.
2. **Injunction**: Force the LLM to write questions where the correct answer **MUST** align with the indices provided by the script.

### Step 3: Dependency Discovery (Pre-Production)
Before writing any code, you MUST verify the environment:
- **Library Audit**: Use `view_file` on the target library: `C:\Users\elwru\AppData\Roaming\typst\packages\local\bell-sheets\0.1.0\lib.typ`.
  - **Verify**: Correct function names and argument types.
- **Path Verification**: Ensure images are downloaded using Pixabay Skill: `C:\PROJECTS\LESSONS AND SLIDESHOWS 2\skills\searching-pixabay\scripts\download_image.py`.

### Step 4: Content & Layout Strategy
- **Rule: Verbatim Mandate**: **CRITICAL**. You MUST use the source text EXACTLY as provided in the raw files.
  - NEVER abbreviate long definitions.
  - NEVER truncate lists of examples.
  - NEVER change punctuation or tone.
- **Rule: Paragraph Numbering**: **MANDATORY**. 
  - All reading texts MUST have numbered paragraphs to facilitate classroom reference.
  - Prefix every paragraph with a bold, maroon number: `#text(fill: maroon, weight: "bold")[[1]]`.
- **Rule: Multiple Choice Formatting**: **MANDATORY**. 
  - NEVER use run-on lines for choices. Use vertical enums or 2-column grids.
- **Rule: Question-Answer Integrity**: **MANDATORY**.
  - Questions and their corresponding ruled lines MUST be wrapped in a non-breakable block (e.g., `#block(breakable: false, [...])`) to prevent them from being separated by page breaks.
- **Rule: Handwriting Space**: **MANDATORY**.
  - All ruled lines for handwriting MUST have a minimum vertical clearance of 0.8cm (`#v(0.8cm)`).
- **Rule: Dynamic Writing Lines**: **MANDATORY**.
  - Writing tasks MUST use a dynamic line generator (e.g., `#writing_lines_dynamic()`) to fill the remaining vertical space on the page.
- **Rule: Page Break Restrictions**: **MANDATORY**.
  - NEVER put a manual page break (`#pagebreak()`) immediately after the main reading text.
- **Rule: Single-Column & Natural Flow (Starting State)**: **MANDATORY**. 
  - ALWAYS start the first draft with a **single-column layout**.

### Step 5: Design Strategy & Styling
For detailed typography, spacing, and branding standards, refer to **[styling.md](references/styling.md)**.

### Step 6: Rendering & Validation
1. **Compile**:
   ```powershell
   typst compile "inputs/[folder]/[filename].typ" "inputs/[folder]/published/DD-MM-YYYY-[LEVEL]-[TITLE].pdf" --root "."
   ```
2. **Validate**:
   ```powershell
   python scripts/validate_text.py "path/to/source.typ"
   ```

### Step 7: 🏁 THE LINK GATE
> [!CRITICAL]
> **YOU MUST PROVIDE A CLICKABLE LINK TO THE PDF.**
> Post the link using the `file:///` protocol. Do NOT proceed until the user approves the visual output.
