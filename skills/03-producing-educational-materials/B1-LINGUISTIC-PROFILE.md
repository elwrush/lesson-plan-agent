# B1 Linguistic Profile: Educational Text Standards

This document defines the linguistic and rhetorical standards for B1 (Intermediate) educational texts, based on the analysis of high-quality pedagogical materials.

## 1. Rhetoric & Tone
*   **Signposting (Informative Texts)**: Uses rhetorical questions as section headers to signpost content (e.g., "Why leave?", "Where next?"). Note: This is usually omitted in literary narratives.
*   **Structure (Narratives)**: Uses dramatic contrast and emotional appeals while maintaining high readability.
*   **Approach**: Factual and informative but grounded in human-centric narratives.
*   **Impact**: Uses controlled metaphors or analogies for scale (e.g., "a tsunami of people") while maintaining a neutral, non-sensationalist tone.

## 2. Coherence & Cohesion
*   **Logical Flow**: Sequential progression (Problem -> Journey -> Personal Case Study -> Outcome).
*   **Conjunctions**: Relies on standard coordinating and subordinating conjunctions: *but, however, although, because, while*.
*   **Referencing**: Clear anaphoric referencing (*this, these, there, they*) to maintain link between sentences without repetition.
*   **Contrast**: Effective usage of "However" and "Though" to show complexity without over-complicating sentence structure.

## 3. Lexis (Vocabulary)
*   **Topic-Driven**: Heavy use of subject-specific nouns (e.g., *refugee, detention center, host country, healthcare*) paired with high-frequency functional words.
*   **Phrasal Verbs**: Uses common phrasal verbs (*pack up, end up, drive out, move away*).
*   **Collocations**: Uses standard collocations (*make a choice, face danger, lead to a lack of, cross the border*).
*   **Adjectives**: Descriptive but high-frequency (*dangerous, enormous, difficult, enormous*).

## 4. Grammatical Structures
*   **Tenses**: 
    *   **Present Simple**: For facts, general truths, and current situations.
    *   **Past Simple**: For narratives and completed actions in case studies.
    *   **Present Continuous**: For current trends (e.g., "Aid workers were expecting...").
*   **Sentence Complexity**:
    *   Mix of simple and compound sentences.
    *   Controlled use of relative clauses (e.g., "which often lead to...").
    *   Use of non-defining relative clauses for adding detail.
*   **Voice**: Effective use of the **Passive Voice** when the agent is unknown or less important (*was destroyed, was rescued, he was told*).
*   **Subordination**: Frequent use of *because* for causality and *if* for conditional situations.
