### Command Line
```bash
python skills/publishing-worksheets/scripts/publish_to_drive.py --file <path_to_pdf>
```

### Workflow
1.  **Generate** the worksheet PDF using the `generating-worksheets` skill.
2.  **Validate** the PDF locally (open file to check branding/layout before upload).
3.  **Publish** using this skill - the Google Drive link will appear in task artifacts.
