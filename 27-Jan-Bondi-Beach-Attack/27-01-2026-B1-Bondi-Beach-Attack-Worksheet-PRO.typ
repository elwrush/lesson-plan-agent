  At least 15 people have been killed in what authorities are calling a "deadly terror attack" at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach. Two gunmen with weapons fired at an event in a park where members of Sydney's Jewish community had gathered to celebrate Hanukkah. 
  
  Stories of immense bravery have emerged. One local man, Ahmed Al Ahmed, has been hailed as a hero by the New South Wales premier for his role in disarming one of the gunmen. "Ordinary Australians rushing towards danger to show the best of our character," the premier stated. Use the lines below to summarize the primary threat.
