#text(weight: "bold", fill: maroon, size: 13pt)[Grammar Focus: Relative Clauses] \
We use relative clauses to describe or give extra information about an *object*, *person*, or *place*. This allows us to combine two ideas into one sophisticated sentence, which is essential for B1 level communication.

#text(weight: "bold")[Defining vs. Non-defining] \
Defining clauses give *essential* information (no commas). Non-defining clauses give *extra* information and must be surrounded by *commas*.
_Example (ND):_ Pomegranates, which are delicious, are rich in vitamins.
