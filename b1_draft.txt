[1] Most people think fear is a bad feeling, but it can actually be very positive for us. Fear is natural and we are all born with it. We have always needed it to keep us safe from danger. In a dangerous situation, we can often find extra strength and energy that we usually do not know we have. It is amazing what our body can do when it truly needs to.

[2] Long ago, humans faced danger every day, so they learned to act very quickly to stay alive. This natural reaction is also seen in many animals. For example, cuttlefish can change their color and shape. They use this to both fight and hide. By using bright colors, they make other fish move slower and easier to catch. Their color also helps them to hide in their environment. The electric eel uses an electric shock to catch food and for self-defense, which is an action to protect itself from others. Humans do not have such unusual powers, but we still have a "fight or flight" instinct. This is the body's natural way of keeping us safe by either facing the danger or getting away as quickly as possible.

[3] Our bodies react in several different ways when we are in danger. Our reactions get faster, we become stronger, and we have more energy. Under pressure, we can become very nervous. This means simple skills, like putting a key in a door, often become much harder. However, physical abilities like running and jumping usually get better. If an angry dog runs after you, you will probably run much faster. Usually, we only use about 65% of our strength, but studies show this can increase to 85% in dangerous situations.

[4] How does the body create this reaction? Fear is a natural reaction in the brain to a stressful situation. It is the body's internal way of trying to stay calm. In the brain, hormones are released that make our heart beat faster and our breathing much quicker. This response is known as the "fight or flight" response. It makes it very difficult for a person to remain calm. Instead, your body wants you to run away or fight the thing that scared you.

[5] The brain makes the body release over 30 different hormones. One is adrenaline, which is a chemical that gives you more energy when you are scared, excited, or angry. These hormones cause many reactions to keep us safe. Our eyes change to let more light in. Some of the body relaxes to let more air in. Other parts become tense because of the adrenaline and glucose, which is a sugar produced in the body. More blood is sent to our muscles and our organs, like the heart and other parts that do specific jobs to keep us alive. We often feel cold because our bodies are keeping our organs safe instead of keeping the skin warm. It is also why we feel tired when we recover from a shock. Fear is designed to protect us.

[6] We do not face many physical dangers today, but fear still helps keep us safe. It stops us from doing dangerous things, like walking into a busy road or being careless on a high building. It limits the risks we take. However, these limits can also take away opportunities. One common fear is a fear of failure. Many people are not willing to take risks because they are too scared of failing. This can lead to people not taking good chances. The risk of making a mistake is reduced, but it also means people are less likely to try new things and may achieve less. This desire to avoid failure can make people act differently.

[7] While fear may make people work more slowly or limit opportunities, it can also make us better at certain things. People who experience fear often are usually better at making decisions because they understand the risk more quickly. If people only ever see the positives, they might not pay attention to negative information. As a result, this can make them poor at making important choices.

[8] When we combine fear with training, the results are very positive. If we are well-trained and prepared, we can react to stressful situations in a calm way. Fear and adrenaline from the instinct make you quick to respond, while training means you know exactly what to do. This is why emergency workers train for many situations and can stay calm when others might panic. Fear can be used to your advantage as long as you plan ahead and do your research.
